<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>Many years ago a friend remarked to me on the strangeness of the
circumstance that the greatest event in the history of a nation, its
conversion to Christianity, largely as it is often recorded in national
legends, has never been selected as a theme for poetry. That event may
indeed not supply the materials necessary for an Epic or a Drama, yet it
can hardly fail to abound in details significant and pathetic, which
especially invite poetic illustration. With the primary interest of that
great crisis, many others, philosophical, social, and political,
generally connect themselves. Antecedent to a nation's conversion, the
events of centuries have commonly either conduced to it, or thrown
obstacles in its way; while the history as well as the character of that
nation in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>subsequent ages is certain to have been in a principal
measure modified by that event. Looking back consequently on that period
in which the moral influences of ages, early and late, are imaged, a
people recognises its own features as in a mirror, but sees them such as
they were when their expression was still undetermined; and it may well
be struck by the resemblance at once to what now exists, and also by the
dissimilitude. Many countries have unhappily lost almost all authentic
records connected with their conversion. Such would have been the fate
of England also, had it not been for a single book, 'Bede's
Ecclesiastical History.' In the following poems I have endeavoured to
walk in the footsteps of that great master. Their scope will best be
indicated by some remarks upon the character of that wonderful age which
he records.</p>


<p class="break">St. Augustine landed in the Isle of Thanet <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 597, and Bede died <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
735. The intervening period, that of his chronicle, is the golden age of
Anglo-Saxon sanctity. Notwithstanding some twenty or thirty years of
pagan reaction, it <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>was a time of rapid though not uninterrupted
progress, and one of an interest the more touching when contrasted with
the calamities which followed so soon. Between the death of Bede and the
first Danish invasion, were eighty years, largely years of decline,
moral and religious. Then followed eighty years of retribution, those of
the earlier Danish wars, till, with the triumph of Alfred, England's
greatest king, came the Christian restoration. Once more periods of
relaxed morals and sacrilegious princes alternated with intervals of
reform; again and again the Northmen over-swept the land. The 460 years
of Anglo-Saxon Christianity constituted a period of memorable
achievements and sad vicissitudes; but that period included more than a
hundred years of high sanctity, belonging for the most part to the
seventh century, a century to England as glorious as was the thirteenth
to Medi√¶val Europe.</p>

<p>Within that century the kingdoms of the Heptarchy successively became
Christian, and those among them which had relapsed returned to the
Faith. Sovereigns, many of whom had boasted a descent from Odin himself,
stood as interpreters <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>beside the missionaries when they preached, and
rivalled each other in the zeal with which they built churches, some of
which were founded on the sites of ancient temples, though, in other
cases, with a charitable prudence, the existing fanes were spared,
purified, and adapted to Christian worship. At Canterbury and York,
cathedrals rose, and on many a site besides; and when the earlier had
been destroyed by fire, or had fallen through decay, fabrics on a vaster
scale rose above their ruins, and maintained a succession which lasts to
this day. Monasteries unnumbered lifted their towers above the forests
of a land in which the streams still ran unstained and the air of which
had not yet been dimmed by smoke, imparting a dignity to fen and flat
morass. Round them ere long cities gathered, as at St. Albans,
Malmesbury, Sherborne, and Wimborne; the most memorable of those
monasteries being that at Canterbury, and that at Westminister,
dedicated to St. Peter, as the cathedral church near it had been
dedicated to St. Paul. In the North they were at least as numerous. The
University of Oxford is also associated with that early age. It was
beside the Isis <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>that St. Frideswida raised her convent, occupied at a
later date by canons regular, and ultimately transformed into Christ
Church by Cardinal Wolsey&mdash;becoming thus the chief, as it had been the
earliest, among the schools in that great seat of learning which within
our own days has exercised a religious influence over England not less
remarkable than that which belonged to its most palmy preceding period.</p>

<p>During that century England produced most of those saintly kings and
queens whose names still enrich the calendar of the Anglo-Saxon Church,
sovereigns who ruled their kingdoms with justice, lived in
mortification, went on pilgrimages, died in cloisters. The great
missionary work had also begun. Within a century from the death of St.
Augustine, apostles from England had converted multitudes in Germany,
and St. Wilfrid had preached to the inhabitants of Friesland. Something,
moreover, had been done to retrieve the past. The Saxon kings made
amends for the wrongs inflicted by their ancestors upon the British
Celts, endowing with English lands the churches and convents founded by
them in Brittany. King Kenwalk <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>of Wessex showed thus also a royal
munificence to the Celtic monastery of Glastonbury, only stipulating in
return that the British monks there, condoning past injuries, should
offer a prayer for him when they knelt at the tomb of King Arthur.</p>

<p>The England of the seventh century had been very gradually prepared for
that drama of many ages which had then its first rehearsal. In it three
races had a part. They were those of the native Britons, the Saxons who
had over-run the land, and the Irish missionaries. Rome, the last and
greatest of the old-world empires, had exercised more of an enfeebling
and less of an elevating influence among the British than among her
other subject races; but her great military roads still remained the
witnesses of her military genius; and many a city, some in ruin, were
records of her wealth and her arts. The Teutonic race in England, which
for centuries had maintained its independence against Rome, could not
forgive the Britons for having submitted to their hated foe, and
trampled on them the more ruthlessly because they despised them. Yet
they at least might well have learned to respect that race. It has been
well remarked that if the Britons submitted easily <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>to Rome, yet of all
her subject races they made far the most memorable fight against that
barbaric irruption which swept over the ruins of her empire. For two
centuries that race had fought on. It still retained the whole of
Western Britain, Cornwall, Wales, and Strathclyde; while in other parts
of England it possessed large settlements. On the other hand, in matters
of spiritual concern the British race contrasted unfavourably with the
other races subjected by the barbarians. In France, Spain, and Italy,
the conquered had avenged a military defeat by a spiritual victory,
bringing over their conquerors to Christianity; and, as a consequence,
they had often risen to equality with them. In those parts of England,
on the contrary, where the British had submitted to the Pagan
conquerors, they by degrees abandoned their Christian faith;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and
where they retained their independence, they hated the Saxon conquerors
too much to share their <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>Christianity with them. Far from desiring their
conversion, they resisted all the overtures made to them by the Roman
missionaries who ardently desired their aid; and as a consequence of
that refusal, they eventually lost their country. The chief cause of
that refusal was hatred of the invader. The Irish as well as the British
had a passionate devotion to their own local traditions in a few matters
not connected with doctrine; but they notwithstanding worked cordially
with the Benedictines from St. Gregory's convent for the spread of the
Christian Faith. Had the Britons converted the Anglo-Saxon race they
would probably have blended with them, as at a later time that race
blended with their Norman conquerors. Three successive waves of the
Teuton-Scandinavian race swept over their ancient land, the Anglo-Saxon,
the Danish, and the Norman: against them all the British Celts fought
on. They fell back toward their country's western coasts, like the Irish
of a later day; and within their Cambrian mountains they maintained
their independence for eight centuries.</p>

<p>Yet the Anglo-Saxons' victory was not an <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>unmixed one. Everywhere
throughout England they maintained during the seventh century two
different battles, a material and a spiritual one, and with opposite
results. Year by year that race pushed further its military dominion;
but yearly the Christian Faith effected new triumphs over that of Odin.
For this there were traceable causes. The character of the Teutonic
invader included two very different elements, and the nobler of these
had its affinities with Christianity. If, on the one hand, that
character was fierce, reckless, and remorseless, and so far in natural
sympathy with a religion which mocked at suffering and till the ninth
century offered up human sacrifices, it was marked no less by
robustness, simplicity, honesty, sincerity, an unexcitable energy and an
invincible endurance. It possessed also that characteristic which
essentially contradistinguishes the <i>ordo equestris</i> from the <i>ordo
pedestris</i> in human character, viz., the spirit of reverence. It had
aspirations; and, as a background to all its musings and all its hopes
there remained ever the idea of the Infinite. As a consequence, it
retained a large measure of self-respect, purity, and that veneration
for household ties attri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>buted to it by the Roman historian<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> at a time
when that virtue was no longer a Roman one. Such a character could not
but have its leanings toward Christianity; and, when brought under its
influences, it put forth at once new qualities, like a wild flower
which, on cultivation, acquires for the first time a perfume. Its spirit
of reverence developed into humility, and its natural fortitude into a
saintly patience; while its fierceness changed into a loyal fervour; and
the crimes to which its passions still occasionally hurried it were
voluntarily expiated by penances as terrible. Even King Penda, the hater
of Christianity, hated an insincere faith more. 'Of all men,' he said,
'he that I have ever most despised is the man who professes belief in
some God and yet does not obey his laws.' Such was that character
destined to produce under the influences of faith such noble specimens
of Christian honour and spiritual heroism. From the beginning its
greatness was one</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">True to the kindred points of Heaven and Home;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span></p><p>and in later ages it became yet more eminently domestic, combining
household ties with the pursuit of letters and science in colleges which
still preserved a family life. Its monks had no vocation to the life of
the desert; in this unlike the Irish saints, who, like those of Eastern
lands, delighted in the forest hermitage and the sea-beat rock.</p>

<p>The Anglo-Saxon race was but a branch of that great Teuton-Scandinavian
race, generically one whether it remained in the German forests or
wandered on to the remoter coasts of Denmark, Sweden and Norway. It was
the race which the Romans called 'the Barbarians,' but which they could
never conquer. A stern history had trained it for a wonderful destiny.
Christianity in mastering the Greek had possessed itself of the
intellect of the world, and in mastering Rome had found access to all
those vast regions conquered by Roman arms, opened out by Roman roads,
governed by Roman law, and by it helped to the conception of a higher
law. But the Greek and the Roman civilisations had, each of them,
corrupted its way, and yielded to the seductions of pride, sense, and
material prosperity; and, as a consequence, both had become <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>incapable
of rendering full justice to much that is highest in Christianity. That
which they lacked the 'Barbaric' race alone was capable of supplying. In
its wanderings under darkened skies and amid pitiless climates it had
preserved an innocence and simplicity elsewhere lost. Enriched by the
union of the new element, thus introduced, with what it had previously
derived from Greek thought and Roman law, that authentic Religion which
had been prospectively sown within the narrow precinct of Judea extended
its branches over the world. Had the Barbaric race shared in the Greek
sciences and arts, and clothed itself in the Roman civilisation, it must
have learned their corruptions. The larger destiny of man could thus,
humanly speaking, never have been accomplished, and neither the medi√¶val
world, the modern world, nor that yet higher order of human society
which doubtless lies beyond both, could have existed. It was necessary
that in some region, exacting, yet beneficent, civilisation should be
retarded, that a remedy might be found for the abuses of civilisation;
and races whose present backward condition we are accustomed to deplore
may likewise be intended for a similar purpose. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>Plants are thus kept in
the dark in order to reserve their fruitage for a fitter season.</p>

<p>But what had been the earlier history of a race before which such
destinies lay? What training had prepared it for its work&mdash;the last that
might have been expected from it? On this subject there remains a
tradition, the profoundly significant character of which ought to have
made it more widely known. Mallet, in his 'Northern Antiquities,'
translated by Bishop Percy, to whom our ballad literature is so deeply
indebted, records it thus:&mdash;'A celebrated tradition, confirmed by the
poems of all the northern nations, by their chronicles, by institutions
and customs, some of which subsist to this day, informs us that an
extraordinary person named Odin formerly reigned in the north.... All
their testimonies are comprised in that of Snorri, the ancient historian
of Norway, and in the commentaries and explications which Torph√¶us added
to his narrative. The Roman Commonwealth was arrived at the highest
pitch of power, and saw all the then known world subject to its laws,
when an unforeseen event raised up enemies against it from the very
bosom of the forests of Scythia and on the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>banks of the Tanais.
Mithridates by flying had drawn Pompey after him into those deserts. The
King of Pontus sought there for refuge and new means of vengeance. He
hoped to arm against the ambition of Rome all the barbarous nations his
neighbours, whose liberty she threatened. He succeeded in this at first,
but all those peoples, ill united as allies, ill armed as soldiers, and
still worse disciplined, were forced to yield to the superior genius of
Pompey. Odin is said to have been of their number.... Odin commanded the
√Üsir, whose country must have been situated between the Pontus Euxinus
and the Caspian Sea. Their principal city was Asgard. The worship there
paid to their supreme God was famous throughout the circumjacent
countries. Odin, having united under his banners the youth of the
neighbouring nations, marched towards the north and west of Europe,
subduing, as we are told, all the people he found in his passage, and
giving them to one or other of his sons for subjects. Many sovereign
families of the North are said to be descended from these princes. Thus
Horsa and Hengist, the chiefs of those Saxons who conquered Britain in
the fifth century, counted <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>Odin or Wodin in the number of their
ancestors; it was the same with the other Anglo-Saxon princes as well as
the greatest part of those of lower Germany and the North.'<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Gibbon refers to this ancient tradition, though not as accepting it for
a part of ascertained history, yet in a spirit less sceptical than was
usual to him. He writes thus: 'It is supposed that Odin was chief of a
tribe of barbarians which dwelt on the banks of the lake M&oelig;otis, till
the fall of Mithridates and the arms of Pompey menaced the north with
servitude. That Odin, yielding with indignant fury to a power which he
was unable to resist, conducted his tribe from the frontiers of the
Asiatic Sarmatia into Sweden, with the great design of forming, in that
inaccessible retreat of freedom, a religion and a people which, in some
remote age, might be subservient to his immortal revenge; when his
invincible Goths, armed with martial fanaticism, should issue in
numerous swarms from the neighbourhood of the Polar circle to chastise
the oppressors of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>mankind.... Notwithstanding the mysterious obscurity
of the Edda, we can easily distinguish two persons confounded under the
name of Odin; the god of war, and the great legislator of Scandinavia.
The latter, the Mahomet of the north, instituted a religion adapted to
the climate and to the people. Numerous tribes on either side of the
Baltic were subdued by the invincible valour of Odin, by his persuasive
eloquence, and by the fame which he acquired of a most skilful magician.
The faith that he had propagated during a long and prosperous life he
confirmed by a voluntary death. Apprehensive of the ignominious approach
of disease and infirmity, he resolved to expire as became a warrior. In
a solemn assembly of the Swedes and Goths he wounded himself in nine
mortal places, hastening away (as he asserted with his dying voice) to
prepare the feast of heroes in the palace of the great god of war.'<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>In a note Gibbon adds, referring to the Roman and Oriental part of the
legend: 'This wonderful expedition of Odin, which, by deducing the
enmity of the Goths and Romans from so memorable a <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span>cause, might supply
the noble groundwork of an epic poem, cannot safely be received as
authentic history. According to the obvious sense of the Edda, and the
interpretation of the most skilful critics, Asgard, instead of denoting
a real city of the Asiatic Sarmatia, is the fictitious appellation of
the mystic abode of the gods, the Olympus of Scandinavia.' Whether the
emigration of the Barbaric race from the East be or be not historical,
certainly the grounds upon which Gibbon bases his distrust of it are
slender. He forgot that there might well have been both an earthly
Asgard and also, according to the religion of the north, an Asgard in
heaven, the destined abode of warriors faithful to Odin. Those who after
his death changed their king into a god would, by necessity, have
provided him with a celestial mansion; nor could they have assigned to
it a name more acceptable to a race which blended so closely their
religion with their patriotic love than that of their ancient capital,
from which their great deliverer and prophet had led them forth in
pilgrimage. Let us hope that Gibbon's remark as to the fitness of this
grand legend for the purposes of epic poetry may yet prove <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>prophecy. It
has had one chance already: for we learn from the first book of <i>The
Prelude</i> that the theme was one of those on which the imagination of
Wordsworth rested in youth, when he was seeking a fit subject for epic
song.</p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine a historical legend invested with a greater
moral weight or dignity than belongs to this one. The mighty Republic
was soon to pass into an Empire mightier and more ruthless still, the
heir of all those ancient empires which from the earliest had
represented a dominion founded on the pride of this world, and had
trampled upon human right. A race is selected to work the retribution.
It is qualified for its work by centuries of adversity, only to be
paralleled by the prosperity of its rival. Yet when at last that
retribution comes, it descends more in mercy than in judgment! Great
changes had prepared the world for a new order of things. The centre of
empire had moved eastward from Rome to Constantinople: the spiritual
centre had moved westward from Jerusalem to Rome. The empire had herself
become Christian, and was allowed after that event nearly a century more
of gradual decline. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span>The judgment was not thus averted; but it was
ennobled. Her children were enabled to become the spiritual instructors
of those wild races by which the '<i>State</i> Universal' had been
overwhelmed. That empire indeed, was not so much destroyed as
transformed and extended, a grace rendered possible by her having
submitted to the yoke of Christ; the new kingdoms which constituted the
Christian '<i>Orbis Terrarum</i>' being, for the most part, fragments of it,
while its laws made way into regions wider far, and exercised over them
a vast though modified authority not yet extinct. Here, if anywhere, we
catch glimpses of a hand flashing forth between the clouds, pointing
their way to the nations, and conducting Humanity forward along its
arduous and ascending road. There is a Providence or there could be no
Progress.</p>

<p>For the fulfilment of that part assigned to the 'Barbarians' in this
marvellous drama of the ages, it was necessary that many things should
combine; an exemption from the temptations which had materialised the
races of the south; the severe life that perfects strength; a race
endowed with the physical <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span>strength needed to render such sufferings
endurable; and lastly, an original spiritual elevation inherent in that
race, and capable of making them understand the lesson, and accept their
high destiny. The last and greatest of these qualifications had not been
wanting. Much as the religion of the Barbaric race had degenerated by
the time when it deified its great deliverer, it had inherited the
highest traditions of the early world. Mallet thus describes their
religion in its purity: 'It taught the being of a "Supreme God, master
of the universe, to whom all things are submissive and obedient." Such,
according to Tacitus, was the supreme God of the Germans. The ancient
Icelandic mythology calls him "the Author of everything that existeth;
the eternal, the ancient, the living and awful Being, the searcher into
concealed things, the Being that never changeth." This religion
attributed to the Supreme Deity "an infinite power, a boundless
knowledge, an incorruptible justice," and forbade its followers to
represent Him under any corporeal form. They were not even to think of
confining Him within the enclosure of walls, but were taught that it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span>within woods and consecrated forests that they could serve Him
properly. There He seemed to reign in silence, and to make Himself felt
by the respect which He inspired.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> ... From this Supreme God were
sprung (as it were emanations from His divinity) an infinite number of
subaltern deities and genii, of which every part of the visible world
was the seat and the temple.... To serve this divinity with sacrifices
and prayers, to do no wrong to others, and to be brave and intrepid in
themselves, were all the moral consequences they derived from these
doctrines. Lastly, the belief of a future state cemented and completed
the whole building.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> ... Perhaps no religion ever attributed so much
to a Divine Providence as that of the northern nations.'<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>It was not among the Scandinavians only that the religion of the North
retained long these vestiges of its original purity, and elevation. 'All
the Teutonic nations held the same opinions, and it was upon these that
they founded the obligation of serving the gods, and of being valiant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span>in battle.... One ought to regard in this respect the Icelandic
mythology as a precious monument, without which we can know but very
imperfectly this important part of the religion of <i>our fathers</i>.'<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The earlier and purer doctrine seems to have long survived the
incrustations of later times in the case of a select few. Harold
Harfraga, the first king of all Norway, thus addressed an assembly of
his people: 'I swear and protest in the most sacred manner that I will
never offer sacrifice to any of the gods adored by the people, but to
Him only who hath formed this world, and everything we behold in it.' A
belief in the divine Love, as well as the divine power, knowledge and
justice, though probably not held by the many at a later day, is yet
distinctly expressed, as well as the kindred belief in an endless reign
of peace, by the earliest and most sacred document of the Northern
religion, viz. the 'V√∂lusp√° Prophecy.' That prophecy, after foretelling
the destruction of all things, including the Odin gods themselves, by
the Supreme God and His ministers, proceeds: 'There will arise out of
the sea, another earth <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[Pg xxix]</a></span>most lovely and verdant with pleasant fields
where the grain shall grow unsown. Vidar and Vali, shall survive;
neither the flood nor Surtur's fire shall harm them. They shall dwell on
the plain of Ida <i>where Asgard formerly stood</i>.... Baldur and H√∂dur
shall also repair thither from the abode of death. There they shall sit
and converse together, and call to mind their former knowledge and the
perils they underwent.'<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The similarity between the higher doctrines of the northern faith and
the religion of ancient Persia is at once accounted for by the tradition
of the Odin migration from the East. A writer the reverse of credulous
expresses himself thus on that subject: 'We know that the Scandinavians
came from some country of Asia.... This doctrine was in many respects
the same with that of the Magi. Zoroaster had taught that the conflict
between Ormuzd and Ahriman (<i>i.e.</i> light and darkness, the Good and Evil
Principle) should continue to the last day; and that then the Good
Principle should be reunited to the Supreme God, from whom it had first
issued; the Evil should be overcome and subdued; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[Pg xxx]</a></span>darkness should be
destroyed; and the world, purified by a universal conflagration, should
become a luminous and shining abode, into which evil should never be
permitted to enter.'<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The same writer continues thus: 'Odin and the
√Üsir may be compared to Ormuzd and the Amshaspands; Loki and his evil
progeny, the Wolf Fenrir and the Midgard Serpent, together with the
giants and monsters of J√∂tunheim and Hvergelmir, to Ahriman and the
Devs.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> ... We will not deny that some of these doctrines may have
been handed down by oral tradition to the pontiff-chieftains of the
Scandinavian tribes, and that the Skalds who composed the mythic poems
of the elder Edda may have had an obscure and imperfect knowledge of
them. Be this as it may, we must not forget that the higher doctrines of
the Scandinavian system were confined to the few, whereas those of the
Zendavesta were the religious belief of the whole nation.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> ... The
Persian system was calculated to form an energetic, intellectual and
highly moral people; the Scandinavian a semi-barbarous troop of crafty
and re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[Pg xxxi]</a></span>morseless warriors.... Yet, such as they were, these
Scandinavians seemed to have been destined by the inscrutable designs of
Providence to invigorate at least one of the nations of which they were
for centuries the scourge, in order, as we previously had occasion to
observe, that the genial blending of cognate tribes might form a people
the most capable of carrying on the great work of civilisation, which in
some far distant age may finally render this world that abode of peace
and intellectual enjoyment dimly shadowed forth in ancient myths as only
to be found in a renovated and fresh emerging universe.'<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The inferiority of the later Scandinavian to the earlier Persian
religion may be sufficiently accounted for by the common process of
gradual degeneration. That degeneration was not confined to the great
emigrant race. Centuries before Odin had left the East, the Persian
religion had degenerated upon its native soil. Its Magi retained a pure
doctrine, which led them later to the Bethlehem crib; but its vulgar had
in part yielded to the seduction of Greek poets, and worshipped in
temples like theirs. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[Pg xxxii]</a></span>It is remarkable that that 'one of the nations'
with which the hopes of the future are so singularly connected is that
one upon which the discipline of adversity had fallen with double force.
When the ancient enemy of the 'Barbaric races,' Rome, had passed away, a
new enemy, and one to it more formidable, rose up against England in her
own kinsfolk, the Scandinavian branch of the same stock. The Danish
invaders expected to set kingdom against kingdom throughout the
Heptarchy, and subject them all to the sceptre of Odin. On the contrary,
it united them in one; and that union was facilitated by the bond of a
common Christianity.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>That the belief of the Anglo-Saxons, though less developed by poetry and
romance, was substantially the same as that recorded in the Scandinavian
Edda, appears to be certain. It is thus that Mr. Kemble speaks:</p>

<p>'On the Continent as well as in England, it is only by the collection of
minute and isolated facts&mdash;often preserved to us in popular
superstitions, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[Pg xxxiii]</a></span>legends, and even nursery tales&mdash;that we can render
probable the prevalence of a religious belief identical in its most
characteristic features with that which we know to have been entertained
in Scandinavia. Yet whatsoever we can thus recover proves that, in all
main points, the faith of the Island Saxons was that of their
Continental brethren.' 'The early period at which Christianity triumphed
in England, adds to the difficulties which naturally beset the subject.
Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, had entered into public relations with the
rest of Europe long before the downfall of their ancient creed; here the
fall of heathendom, and the commencement of history were
contemporaneous. We too had no Iceland to offer a refuge to those who
fled from the violent course of a conversion.'<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Among the proofs of identity between the Anglo-Saxon and the
Scandinavian religion, Mr. Kemble refers to the fact that 'genealogies
of the Anglo-Saxon kings contain a multitude of the ancient gods,
reduced indeed into the family relations, but still capable of
identification with the deities of the North, and of Germany. In this
relation we <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[Pg xxxiv]</a></span>find Odin, B&oelig;ld&oelig;g, G√©at, Wig, and Frea. The days of
the week, also dedicated to gods, supply us further with the names of
Tiw, Dunor, Friege, and S&oelig;tere; and the names of places in all parts
of England attest the wide dispersion of the worship.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Kemble shows also that among the Anglo-Saxons and the Scandinavians
there existed a common belief respecting monsters, especially the wolf
Fenrir, the Midgard snake, evil spirits and giants; respecting Loki, the
accursed spirit, and Hela, the queen of Hades. To the same effect Mr.
Sharon Turner speaks: 'The Volusp√° and the Edda are the two great
repositories of the oldest and most venerated traditions of pagan
Scandinavia. The Volusp√° opens abruptly, and most probably represents
many of the ancient <i>Saxon</i> traditions or imaginations.'<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The
authority of these eminent writers accounts for and justifies the
frequent references to the Scandinavian mythology in the following
'Saxon Legends.'</p>

<p>We have thus seen that in the religion of the 'Barbaric' race there were
blended two different elements: a higher one derived from its eastern
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[Pg xxxv]</a></span>origin, and a lower one the result of gradual degeneration. We had
previously seen that a remarkable duality was to be found in the
character of that race; and without understanding this duality and its
root in their religion, no just conception can be formed of the
relations of that race with Christianity. Had the 'Barbarians' possessed
nothing deeper than is indicated by their fiercer traits, the history of
the seventh century in England must have been very different. It was
characterised by rapid conversions to Christianity on a large scale, and
often, after the lapse of a few years, by sanguinary revolts against the
Faith. The chief reason of such fluctuation seems to have been this,
viz. because all that was profound, and of venerable antiquity in the
Northern religion, was in sympathy with Christianity, as the religion of
sanctity and self-sacrifice; while all that was savage in it opposed
itself to a religion of humility and of charity. The Northern religion
was an endless warfare, and so was that early Persian religion from
which its higher element was derived; but by degrees that warfare had,
for the many, ceased to be the warfare between light and dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[Pg xxxvi]</a></span>ness,
between Good and Evil. To the speculative it had become a conflict
between all the wild and illimitable forces of Nature and some unknown
higher Law; but to the common herd it meant only an endless feud between
race and race. Thus understood it could have no affinities with
Christianity, either in her militant character, or as the religion of
peace.</p>

<p>In explanation of the frequent outbreaks against Christianity on the
part of the Anglo-Saxons, after their conversion, Montalembert assigns
another cause, viz. that the Roman missionaries had sometimes relied too
much upon the converted kings, and their authority over their subjects.
The work had in such cases to be done again; and it was largely done by
Irish missionaries, who had left Iona only to seek as lonely a retreat
in Lindisfarne. They shunned cities, drew the people to them, and worked
upwards through that people to the great.</p>

<p>The Irish mission in England during the seventh century was one among
the great things of history, and has met with an inadequate
appreciation. The ancient name of the Irish, 'Scoti,' commemorative of
their supposed Scythian origin, the name <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[Pg xxxvii]</a></span>by which Bede always
designates them, had been frequently translated 'Scottish' by modern
historians; and those who did not know that an Irish immigrant body had
entered Scotland, then called Alba, about the close of the second
century, had conquered its earlier inhabitants, the Picts, after a war
of centuries, and had eventually given to that heroic land, never since
subdued, its own name and its royal house, naturally remained ignorant
that those 'Scottish' missionaries were Irish. A glance at Bede,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> or
such well known recent works as Sir W. Scott's 'History of
Scotland,'<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> makes this matter plain; yet the amount of work done in
England by those Irish missionaries is still known to few.</p>

<p>They came from a country the fortunes, the character, and the
institutions of which were singu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[Pg xxxviii]</a></span>larly unlike those of England; one in
which ancient Rome had had no part; which, in the form of clan-life,
retained as its social type the patriarchal customs of its native East,
all authority being an expansion of domestic authority, and the idea of
a family, rather than that of a state, ruling over the hearts of men.
About two centuries previously, Ireland had become Christian; and an
image of its immemorial clan-system was reproduced in the vast convents
which ere long covered the land, and sent forth their missionaries over
a large part of Europe. It might well have been thought doubtful whether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[Pg xxxix]</a></span>these were likely to work successfully among a race so dissimilar as
the Anglo-Saxon; but the event proved that in this instance dissimilar
qualities meant qualities complemental to each other, and that sympathy
was attracted by unlikeness.</p>

<p>The Irish mission in England began at a critical time, just when the
reaction against the earlier successes of the Roman mission had set in.
At York, under Paulinus, Christianity had triumphed; but eight years
after that event Edwin, the Christian king of D√´ira, perished in battle,
and northern England was forced back by king Penda into paganism.
Southern England, with the exception of Canterbury and a considerable
part of Kent, had also lost the Gospel, after possessing it for thirty
years. Nearly at the same time East Anglia and Essex, at the command of
pagan-kings, had discarded it likewise. It was then that Oswald, on
recovering his kingdom of Northumbria, besought the Irish monks of Iona
to reconvert it, or rather to complete a conversion which had been but
begun. Their work prospered; by degrees the largest kingdom of the
Heptarchy became solidly and permanently Christian, its See being fixed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[Pg xl]</a></span>in the Island of Lindisfarne, whence the huge diocese of the north was
ruled successively by three of St. Columba's order, Aidan, Finan, and
Colman. But the labours of St. Columba's sons were not confined to the
north. In East Anglia an Irish monk, St. Fursey, founded on the coast of
Suffolk the monastery of Burghcastle, in which King Sigebert became a
monk. An Irish priest, Maidulphus, built that of Malmesbury in Wessex.
Glastonbury was an older Celtic monastery inhabited partly by Irish
monks, and partly by British. Peada, king of Mercia, son of the terrible
Penda, was baptized by St. Finan close to the Roman Wall, as was also
Sigebert, king of the East Saxons. Diama, an Irish monk, was first
bishop of all Mercia, its second, C√©olach, being Irish also, and also
its fourth.</p>

<p>Montalembert, in his <i>Moines d'Occident</i>, has given us the most
delightful history that exists of the conversion of Anglo-Saxon England,
a work combining the depth of a Christian philosopher with the sagacity
of a statesman, and a dramatist's appreciation of character, while in it
we miss nothing of that picturesque vividness and engaging simplicity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[Pg xli]</a></span>which belong to our early chroniclers; thus conferring upon England a
boon if possible greater than that bestowed upon Ireland in his lives of
St. Columba, St. Columbanus and other saints. It is thus that he
apportions the share which the Irish missionaries and the Roman had in
that great enterprise.</p>

<p>'En r√©sumant l'histoire des efforts tent√©s pendant les soixante ans
√©coul√©s depuis le d√©barquement d'Augustin jusqu'√† la mort de Penda, pour
introduire le Christianisme en Angleterre, on constate les r√©sultats que
voici. Des huit royaumes de la conf√©d√©ration Anglo-Saxonne, celui de
Kent fut seul exclusivement conquis et conserv√© par les moines romains,
dont les premi√®res tentatives, chez les Est-Saxons et les Northumbriens,
se termin√®rent par un √©chec. En Wessex et en Est-Anglie les Saxons √†
l'ouest et les Angles √† l'est furent convertis par l'action combin√©e de
missionnaires continentaux et de moines celtiques. Quant aux deux
royaumes Northumbriens' (D√´ira and Bernicia), '√† l'Essex et √† la Mercie,

at that early period to introduce Christianity into the kingdom of the
South-Saxons was that of an Irish monk, Dicul, who founded a small
monastery at Bosham. It did not however prove successful.</p>

<p>There is something profoundly touching in the religious ties which
subsisted between England and Ireland during the seventh century, when
compared with the troubled relations of those two countries during many
a later age. If the memory of benefits received produces a kindly
feeling on the part of the recipient, that of benefits conferred should
exert the same influence on the heart of the bestower. To remember the
past, however disastrous or convulsed, is a nation's instinct, and its
duty no less, since a tribute justly due is thus paid to great actions
and to great sufferings in times gone by; nor among the wise and the
generous can the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[Pg xliii]</a></span>discharge of that patriotic duty ever engender an
enmity against the living: but there is a special satisfaction in
turning to those recollections with which no human infirmity can connect
any feeling save that of good will; and it is scarcely possible to
recall them in this instance without a hope that the sacred bonds which
united those two countries at that remote period may be a pledge for
reciprocated benefits in the ages yet before us. For both countries that
early time was a time of wonderful spiritual greatness. In noble rivalry
with Ireland England also sent her missionaries to far lands; and a
child of Wessex, St. Boniface, brought the Faith to Germany, by which it
was eventually diffused over Scandinavia, thus, by anticipation,
bestowing the highest of all gifts on that terrible race the Northmen,
in later centuries the scourge of his native land.</p>

<p>At home both islands were filled with saints whose names have ever since
resounded throughout Christendom. Both islands, as a great writer<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
has told us, 'had been the refuge of Christianity, for a time almost
exterminated in Christendom, and the centres of its propagation in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[Pg xliv]</a></span>countries still heathen. Secluded from the rest of Europe by the stormy
waters in which they lay, they were converted just in time to be put in
charge with the sacred treasures of Revelation, and with the learning of
the old world, in that dreary time which intervened between Gregory and
Charlemagne. They formed schools, collected libraries, and supplied the
Continent with preachers and teachers.' He remarks also that 'There was
a fitness in the course of things that the two peoples who had rejoiced
in one prosperity should drink together the same cup of suffering:
<i>Amabiles, et decori in vit√¢ su√¢, in morte non divisi</i>;' and he proceeds
to remind us that, immediately after their participation in that common
religious greatness, they partook also a tragic inheritance. In England
for two centuries and a half, in Ireland for a longer period, the
Northmen were repulsed but to reappear. Again and again the sons of Odin
blackened the river-mouths of each land with their fleets; wherever they
marched they left behind them the ashes of burned churches and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[Pg xlv]</a></span>monasteries, till, in large parts of both, Christianity and learning
had well nigh perished, and barbarism had all but returned. In both
countries domestic dissensions had favoured the invader; eventually in
both the Danish power broke down; but in both and in each case claiming
a spiritual sanction&mdash;another branch of the same Scandinavian stock
succeeded to the Dane, viz. the only one then Christianised, the Norman.
In that seventh century how little could Saxon convert or Irish
missionary have foreseen that the destinies of their respective
countries should be at once so unlike yet so like, so antagonistic yet
so interwoven!</p>


<p class="break">The aim of the 'Legends of Saxon Saints,' as the reader will perhaps
have inferred from the preceding remarks, is to illustrate England, her
different races and predominant characteristics, during the century of
her conversion to Christianity, and in doing this to indicate what
circumstances had proved favourable or unfavourable to the reception of
the Faith. It became desirable thus to revert to the early emigration of
that 'Barbaric' race of which the Anglo-Saxon was a scion, making <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[Pg xlvi]</a></span>the
shadow of Odin pass in succession over the background of the several
pictures presented (the Heroic being thus the unconscious precursor of
the Spiritual), and to show how the religion which bore his name was
fitted at once to predispose its nobler votaries to Christianity and to
infuriate against it those who but valued their faith for what it
contained of degenerate. It seemed also expedient to select for
treatment not only those records most abounding in the picturesque and
poetic, but likewise others useful as illustrating the chief
representatives of a many-sided society; the pagan king and the British
warrior, the bard of Odin and the prophetess of Odin, the Gaelic
missionary and the Roman missionary, the poet and the historian of
Anglo-Saxon Christianity. In a few instances, as in the tales of Oswald
and of Oswy, where the early chronicle was copious in detail, it has
been followed somewhat closely; but more often, where the original
record was brief, all except the fundamental facts had to be supplied.
On these occasions I found encouragement in the remark of a writer at
once deep and refined. 'Stories to be versified should not be already
nearly complete, having <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[Pg xlvii]</a></span>the beauty in themselves, and gaining from the
poet but a garb. They should be rough, and with but a latent beauty. The
poet should have to supply the features and limbs as well as the
dress.'<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Bede has been my guide. His records are, indeed, often 'rough,' as rough
as the crab-tree, but, at the same time, as fresh as its blossom. Their
brief touches reveal all the passions of the Barbaric races; but the
chief human affections, things far deeper than the passions, are yet
more abundantly illustrated by them.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> It was a time when those
affections were not frozen by conventionalities and forced to conceal
themselves until they forgot to exist. In the narrative of Bede we find
also invaluable illustrations of a higher but not less real range of
human affections, viz. the affections of 'Christianised Humanity,'
affections grounded on divine truths and heavenly hopes, and yet in
entire harmony with affections of a merely human order, which lie
beneath them in a parallel plane. Occasionally the two classes enter
into conflict, as <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[Pg xlviii]</a></span>in the case of the monks of Bardeney who found it so
difficult to reconcile their reverence for a Saint with their patriotic
hatred of a foreign invader; but almost invariably the earthly and the
heavenly emotions are mutually supplemental, as in those tender
friendships of monk with monk, of king and bishop, grounded upon
religious sympathy and co-operation; so that the lower sentiment without
the higher would present, compared with the pictures now bequeathed to
us, but an unfinished and truncated image of Humanity. Here, again, the
semi-barbaric age described by Bede rendered the delineation more vivid.
In ages of effeminate civilisation the Christian emotions, even more
than those inherent in unassisted human nature, lose that ardour which
belongs to them when in a healthy condition&mdash;an ardour which especially
reveals itself during that great crisis, a nation's conversion, when,
beside a throng of new feelings and new hopes, a host of new Truths has
descended upon the intelligence of a whole people, and when a sense of
new knowledge and endless progress is thus communicated to it, far
exceeding that which is the boast of nations devoted chiefly to physical
science. The sense of progress, indeed, when such a period <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[Pg xlix]</a></span>reaches its
highest, is a rapture. It is as though the motion of the planet which
carries us through space, a motion of which we are cognisant but which
we yet cannot feel, could suddenly become, like the speed of a
racehorse, a thing brought home to our consciousness.</p>

<p>Such ardours are scarcely imaginable in the later ages of a nation; but
in Bede's day a people accepting the 'glad tidings' was glad; and,
unambitious as his style is of the ornamental or the figurative, it is
brightened by that which it so faithfully describes. His chronicle is
often poetry, little as he intended it to be such; nay, it is poetry in
her 'humanities' yet more than in her distinctively spiritual province,
and better poetry than is to be found in the professed poetry of a
materialistic age, when the poet is tempted to take refuge from the
monotony of routine life, either amid the sensational accidents to be
found on the byeways, not the highways, of life, or in some sickly
dreamland that does not dare to deal with life, and belongs neither to
the real nor to the ideal. In nothing is Bede's history of that great
age, to which our own owes all that it possesses of real greatness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[Pg l]</a></span>more striking than in that spirit of unconscious elevation and
joyousness which belongs to the Christian life it records, a joyousness
often so strikingly contrasted with the sadness&mdash;sometimes a heroic
sadness&mdash;to be found in portions of his work describing pagan manners.
With all its violences and inconsistencies, the seventh century was a
noble age&mdash;an age of strong hearts which were gentle as well as strong,
of a childhood that survived in manhood, of natures that had not lost
their moral unity, of holy lives and of happy deaths. Bede's picture of
it is a true one; and for that reason it comes home to us.</p>

<p>To some it may seem a profaneness to turn those old legends into verse.
I should not have attempted the enterprise if they were much read in
prose. The verse may at least help to direct the attention of a few
readers to them. From them the thoughtful will learn how to complete a
'half-truth' often reiterated. Those who have declared that 'the wars of
the Heptarchy are as dull as the battles of kites and crows,' have not
always known that the true interest of her turbulent days belonged to
peace, not to war, and is to be found in the spiritual development of
the Anglo-Saxon race.</p>

resistance to the Roman arms, leads forth his people to the forests
north of the Danube, that, serving God in freedom on the limits of
the Roman Empire, and being strengthened by an adverse climate,
they may one day descend upon that empire in just revenge; which

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Far through the forest depths of Thanet Isle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That never yet had heard the woodman's axe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rang the glad clarion on the May-day morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blent with the cry of hounds. The rising sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flamed on the forests' dewy jewelry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While, under rising mists, a host with plumes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rode down a broad oak alley t'wards the sea.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">King Ethelbert rode first: he reigned in Kent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Least kingdom of the Seven yet Head of all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through his desert. That morn the royal train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While sang the invisible lark her song in heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pursued the flying stag. At times the creature,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span><span class="i0">As though he too had pleasure in the sport,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vaulted at ease through sunshine and through shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then changed his mood, and left the best behind him.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Five hours they chased him; last, upon a rock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High up in scorn he held his antlered front,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then took the wave and vanished.<br /></span>
<span class="i33">Many a frown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Darkened that hour on many a heated brow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a spur afflicted that poor flank<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which panted hard and smoked. The King alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laughed at mischance. 'The stag, with God to aid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has left our labour fruitless! Give him joy!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lives to yield us sport some later morn:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So be it! Waits our feast, and not far off:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On to the left, 'twixt yonder ash and birch!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">He spake, and anger passed: they praised their sport;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many an outblown nostril seemed to snuff<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That promised feast. They rode through golden furze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So high the horsemen only were descried;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And glades whose centuried oaks their branches laid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er violet banks; and fruit trees, some snow-veiled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like bridesmaid, others like the bride herself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind her white veil blushing. Glad, the thrush<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Carolled; more glad, the wood-dove moaned; close by<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A warbling runnel led them to the bay:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span><span class="i0">Two chestnuts stood beside it snowy-coned:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The banquet lay beneath them.<br /></span>
<span class="i30">Feasting o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The song succeeded. Boastful was the strain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each Thane his deeds extolling, or his sire's;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But one, an aged man, among them scoffed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'When I was young; when Sigbert on my right<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To battle rode, and Sefred on my left;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That time men stood not worsted by a stag!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not then our horses swerved from azure strait<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scared by the ridged sea-wave!' Next spake a chief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pirate from Denmark late returned: 'Our skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good friends, are all too soft to build the man!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We fight for fame: the Northman fights for sport;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their annals boast they fled but once:&mdash;'twas thus:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In days of old, when Rome was in her pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Huge hosts of hers had fallen on theirs, surprised,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And way-worn: long they fought: a remnant spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fled to their camp. Upon its walls their wives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood up, black-garbed, with axes heaved aloft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fell upon the fugitives, and slew them;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slew next their little ones; slew last themselves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cheating the Roman Triumph. Never since then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath Northman fled the foemen.'<br /></span>
<span class="i32">Egfrid rose:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Who saith our kinsfolk of the frozen North<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span><span class="i0">One stock with us, one faith, one ancient tongue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pass us in valour? Three days since I saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crossing the East Saxon's border and our own<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two boys that strove. The Kentish wounded fell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The East Saxon on him knelt; then made demand:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"My victim art thou by the laws of war!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yonder my dagger lies;&mdash;till I return<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wilt thou abide?" The vanquished answered, "Yea!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A minute more, and o'er that dagger's edge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His life-blood rushed.' The pirate chief demurred;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'A gallant boy! Not less I wager this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glitter of that dagger ere it smote<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made his eye blink. Attend! Three years gone by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sailing with Hakon on Norwegian fiords<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We fought the Jomsburg Rovers, at their head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sidroc, oath-pledged to marry Hakon's child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Despite her father's best. In mist we met:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instant each navy at the other dashed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like wild beast, instinct-taught, that knows its foe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chained ship to ship, and clashed their clubs all day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till sank the sun: then laughed the white peaks forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And reeled, methought, above the reeling waves!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The victory was with us. Hakon, next morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bade slay his prisoners. Thirty on one bench<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waited their doom: their leader died the first;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He winked not as the sword upon him closed!<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span><span class="i0">No, nor the second! Hakon asked the third,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What think'st thou, friend, of Death?" He tossed his head:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"My Father perished; I fulfil my turn."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fourth, "Strike quickly, Chief! An hour this morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We held contention if, when heads are off,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hand can hold its dagger: I would learn."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dagger and the head together fell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fifth, "One fear is mine&mdash;lest yonder slave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Finger a Prince's hair! Command some chief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy best beloved, to lift it in his hands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then strike and spare not!" Hakon struck. That youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sigurd by name, his forehead forward twitched,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laughing, so deftly that the downward sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shore off those luckless hands that raised his hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All laughed; and Hakon's son besought his sire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To loosen Sigurd's bonds: but Sigurd cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Unless the rest be loosed I will not live!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus all escaped save four.'<br /></span>
<span class="i28">In graver mood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That chief resumed: 'A Norland King dies well!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His bier is raised upon his stateliest ship;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Piled with his arms; his lovers and his friends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rush to their monarch's pyre, resolved with him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To share in death, and with becoming pomp<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Attend his footsteps to Valhalla's Hall.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span><span class="i0">The torch is lit: forth sails the ship, black-winged,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Facing the midnight seas. From beach and cliff<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men watch all night that slowly lessening flame:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet no man sheds a tear.'<br /></span>
<span class="i28">Earconwald,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An aged chief, made answer, 'Tears there be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of divers sorts: a wise and valiant king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deserves that tear which praises, not bewails,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Greatness gone by.' The pirate shouted loud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'A land it is of laughter, not of tears!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Know ye the tale of Harald? He had sailed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round southern coasts and eastern&mdash;sacked or burned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hundred Christian cities. One he found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So girt with giant walls and brazen gates<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sea-kings vainly dashed themselves thereon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And died beneath them, frustrate. Harald sent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A herald to that city proffering terms:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Harald is dead: Christian was he in youth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sends you spoils from many a city burnt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And craves interment in your chiefest church."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next day the masked procession wound in black<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through streets defenceless. When the church was reached<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They laid their chief before the altar-lights:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anon to heaven rang out the priestly dirge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And incense-smoke upcurled. Forth from its cloud<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span><span class="i0">Sudden upleaped the dead man, club in hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spurning his coffin's gilded walls, and smote<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hoary pontiff down, and brake his neck;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all those maskers doffed their weeds of woe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And showed the mail beneath, and raised their swords,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drowned that pavement in a sea of blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While raging rushed their mates through portals wide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, since that city seemed but scant of spoil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fired it and sailed. Ofttimes old Harald laughed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That tale recounting,'<br /></span>
<span class="i24">Many a Kentish chief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Re-echoed Harald's laugh;&mdash;not Ethelbert:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The war-scar reddening on his brow he rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spake: 'My Thanes, ye laugh at deeds accurst!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An old King I, and make my prophecy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One day that northern race which smites and laughs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our kith and kin albeit, shall smite our coasts:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That day ye will not laugh!' Earconwald,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not rising, likewise answer made, heart-grieved:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Six sons had I: all these are slain in war;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet I, an unrejoicing man forlorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Find solace ofttimes thinking of their deeds:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They laughed not when they smote. No God, be sure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smiles on the jest red-handed.' Egfrid rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And three times cried with lifted sword unsheathed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Behold my God! No God save him I serve!'<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span><span class="i2">While thus they held discourse, where blue waves danced<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not far from land, behold, there hove in sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seen 'twixt a great beech silky yet with Spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pine broad-crested, round whose head old storms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had wov'n a garland of his own green boughs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bark both fair and large; and hymn was heard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then laughed the King, 'The stag-hunt and our songs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So drugged my memory, I had nigh forgotten<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why for our feast I chose this heaven-roofed hall:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Missives I late received from friends in France;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They make report of strangers from the South<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, tarrying in their coasts have learned our tongue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And northward wend with tidings strange and new<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some celestial Kingdom by their God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Founded for men of Faith. Nor churl am I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To frown on kind intent, nor child to trust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This sceptre of Seven Realms to magic snare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That puissance hath&mdash;who knows not?&mdash;greater thrice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In house than open field. I therefore chose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For audience hall this precinct.'<br /></span>
<span class="i34">Muttered low<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Murdark, the scoffer with the cave-like mouth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sidelong eyes, 'Queen Bertha's voice was that!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A woman's man! Since first from Gallic shores<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That dainty daughter of King Charibert<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The whole land dwindles!'<br /></span>
<span class="i26">In seraphic hymns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere long that serpent hiss was lost: for soon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In raiment white, circling a rocky point,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er sands still glistening with a tide far-ebbed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On drew, preceded by a silver Cross,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A long procession. Music, as it moved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Floated on sea-winds inland, deadened now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By thickets, echoed now from cliff or cave:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere long before them that procession stood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The King addressed them: 'Welcome, Heralds sage!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if from God I welcome you the more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since great is God, and therefore great His gifts:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God grant He send them daily, heaped and huge!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Who brings ill news, or makes inept demand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unmeet for Kings. I know that Cross ye bear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in my palace sits a Christian wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bertha, the sweetest lady in this land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most gracious in her ways, in heart most leal.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I knew her yet a child: she knelt whene'er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Queen, her mother, entered: then I said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A maid so reverent will be reverent wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wedded her betimes. Morning and eve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She in her wood-girt chapel sings her prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span><span class="i0">Which wins us kindlier harvest, and, some think,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Success in war. She strives not with our Gods:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confusion never wrought she in my house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor minished Hengist's glory. Had her voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clangorous or strident, drawn upon my throne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deserved opprobrium'&mdash;here the monarch's brows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flushed at the thought, and fire was in his eyes&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'The hand that clasps this sceptre had not spared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hunt her forth, an outcast in the woods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thenceforth with beasts to herd! More lief were I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To take the lioness to my bed and board<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than house a rebel wife.' Remembering then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mildness of his Queen, King Ethelbert<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resumed, appeased, for placable his heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'But she no rebel is, and this I deem<br /></span>

<span class="i30">A little breeze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warm from the sea that moment softly waved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The standard from its staff, and showed thereon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Child Divine. Upon His mother's knee<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Crowned with a golden Cross; and with His right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two fingers heavenward raised, o'er all the earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sent His Blessing.<br /></span>
<span class="i22">Of that band snow-stoled<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Opened the great commission of the Faith:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Behold the Eternal Maker of the worlds!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Hand which shaped the earth and blesses earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must rule the race of man!'<br /></span>
<span class="i28">Majestic then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when, far winding from its mountain springs,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Some Indian river rolls, while mists dissolved<br /></span>

<span class="i0">There lay the Illimitable in narrow bound:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Star-writ in heaven the words this Standard bears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Through Me is victory." Victory won, he raised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High as his empire's queenly head, and higher,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This Standard of the Eternal Dove thenceforth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fly where eagle standard never flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God's glory in its track, goodwill to man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Advance for aye, great Emblem! Light as now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Famed Asian headlands, and Hellenic isles!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er snow-crowned Alp and citied Apennine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Send forth a breeze of healing! Keep thy throne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ever on those western peaks that watch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The setting sun descend the Hesperean wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Atlas and Calpe! These, the old Roman bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Build but the gateway of the Rome to be;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Christ returns, thou Standard, hold them fast:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But never till the North, that, age by age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dashed back the Pagan Rome, with Christian Rome<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Partakes the spiritual crown of man restored,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From thy strong flight above the world surcease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fold thy wings in rest!'<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span><span class="i28">Upon the sod<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knelt, and on that Standard gazed, and spake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calm-voiced, with hand to heaven: 'I promise thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou Sign, another victory, and thy best&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This island shall be thine!'<br /></span>
<span class="i28">Augustine rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And took the right hand of King Ethelbert,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And placed therein the Standard's staff, and laid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His own above the monarch's, speaking thus:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'King of this land, I bid thee know from God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That kings have higher privilege than they know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The standard-bearers of the King of kings.'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Long time he clasped that royal hand; long time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The King, that patriarch's hand at last withdrawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His own withdrew not from that Standard's staff<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Committed to his charge. His hand he deemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thenceforth its servant vowed. With large, meek eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fixed on that Maid and Babe, he stood as child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, gazing on some reverent stranger's face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor loosening from that stranger's hold his palm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listens his words attent.<br /></span>
<span class="i26">The man of God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime as silent gazed on Thanet's shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gold-tinged, with sunset spray to crimson turned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In league-long crescent. Love was in his face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That love which rests on Faith. He spake: 'Fair land,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span><span class="i0">I know thee what thou art, and what thou lack'st!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Master saith, "I give to him that hath:"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy harvest shall be great.' Again he mused,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shadow o'er him crept. Again he spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'That harvest won, when centuries have gone by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What countenance wilt thou wear? How oft on brows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brightened by Baptism's splendour, sin more late<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drags down its cloud! The time may come when thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This day, though darkling, yet so innocent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Barbaric, not depraved, on greater heights<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May'st sin in malice&mdash;sin the great offence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Changing thy light to darkness, knowing God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet honouring God no more; that time may come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, rich as Carthage, great in arms as Rome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keen-eyed as Greece, this isle, to sensuous gaze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sun all gold, to angels may present<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aspect no nobler than a desert waste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some blind and blinding waste of sun-scorched sands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trod by a race of pigmies not of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pigmies by passions ruled!'<br /></span>
<span class="i28">Once more he mused;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then o'er his countenance passed a second change;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from it flashed the light of one who sees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some hill-top gained, beyond the incumbent night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The instant foot of morn. With regal step,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Martial yet measured, to the King he strode,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span><span class="i0">And laid a strong hand on him, speaking thus:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Rejoice, my son, for God hath sent thy land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This day Good Tidings of exceeding joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And planted in her breast a Tree divine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose leaves shall heal far nations. Know besides,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should sickness blight that Tree, or tempest mar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The strong root shall survive: the winter past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heavenward once more shall rush both branch and bough,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over-vault the stars.'<br /></span>
<span class="i26">He spake, and took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sacred Standard from that monarch's hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And held it in his own, and fixed its point<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in the earth, and by it stood. Then lo!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like one disburthened of some ponderous charge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">King Ethelbert became himself again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And round him gazed well pleased. Throughout his train<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sudden a movement thrilled: remembrance had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of those around, his warriors and his thanes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ever on his wisdom waiting hung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus he replied discreet: 'Stranger and friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou bear'st good tidings! That thou camest thus far<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fool us, knave and witling may believe:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I walk not with their sort; yet, guest revered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kings are not as the common race of men;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Counsel they take, lest honour heaped on one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dishonour others. Odin holds on us<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span><span class="i0">Prescriptive right, and special claims on me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The son of Hengist's grandson. Preach your Faith!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The man who wills I suffer to believe:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The man who wills not, let him moor his skiff<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where anchorage likes him best. The day declines:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This night with us you harbour, and our Queen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall lovingly receive you.'<br /></span>
<span class="i28">Staid and slow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The King rode homewards, while behind him paced<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Augustine and his Monks. The ebb had left<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twixt Thanet and the mainland narrow space<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Marsh-land more late: beyond the ford there wound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A path through flowery meads; and, as they passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not herdsmen only, but the broad-browed kine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fixed on them long their meditative gaze;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And oft some blue-eyed boy with flaxen locks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ran, fearless, forth, and plucked them by the sleeve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some boy clear-browed as those Saint Gregory marked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor slaves, new-landed on the quays of Rome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That drew from him that saying, '"Angli"&mdash;nay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Call them henceforward "Angels"!'<br /></span>
<span class="i34">From a wood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Issuing, before them lustrous they beheld<br /></span>
<span class="i0">King Ethelbert's chief city, Canterbury,<br /></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span><span class="i0">Thick-set with towers. Then fire from God there fell<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Thus sang the Saint, advancing; and, behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At every pause the brethren sang 'Amen!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While down from window and from roof the throng<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eyed them in silence. As their anthem ceased,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before them stood the palace clustered round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By many a stalwart form. Midway the gate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the first step, like angel newly lit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Queen Bertha stood. Back from her forehead meek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The meeker for its crown, a veil descended,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While streamed the red robe to the foot snow-white<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sandalled in gold. The morn was on her face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The star of morn within those eyes upraised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That flashed all dewy with the grateful light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of many a granted prayer. O'er that sweet shape<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Or taught of God, the monarch and his thanes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knelt as she knelt, and bent like her their heads,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sharing her blessing. Like a palm the Faith<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thenceforth o'er England rose, those saintly men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Preaching by life severe, not words alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The doctrine of the Cross. Some Power divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stronger than patriot love, more sweet than Spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made way from heart to heart, and daily God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Joined to His Church the souls that should be saved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thousands, where Medway mingles with the Thames,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rushing to Baptism. In his palace cell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High-nested on that Vaticanian Hill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which o'er the Martyr-gardens kens the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gregory, that news receiving, or from men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or haply from that God with whom he walked,<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As morning brake, Sebert, East Saxon king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood on the winding shores of Thames alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fixed a sparkling eye upon Saint Paul's:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun new-risen had touched its roofs that laughed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their answer back. Beyond it London spread;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all between the river and that church<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was slope of grass and blossoming orchard copse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glittering with dews dawn-reddened. Bertha here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That church begun, had thus besought her Lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Spare me this bank which God has made so fair!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here let the little birds have leave to sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bud to blossom! Here, the vespers o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span><span class="i0">Lovers shall sit; and here, in later days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Children shall question, "Who was he&mdash;Saint Paul?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What taught, what wrought he that his name should shine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus like the stars in heaven?"'<br /></span>
<span class="i34">As Sebert stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sweetness of the morning more and more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made way into his heart. The pale blue smoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rising from hearths by woodland branches fed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dimmed not the crystal matin air; not yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From clammy couch had risen the mist sun-warmed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All things distinctly showed; the rushing tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The barge, the trees, the long bridge many-arched,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And countless huddled gables, far away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lessening, yet still descried.<br /></span>
<span class="i31">A voice benign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dispersed the Prince's trance: 'I marked, my King,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your face in yonder church; you took, I saw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A blessing thence; and Nature's here you find:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The same God sends them both.' The man who spake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though silver-tressed, was countenanced like a child;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smooth-browed, clear-eyed. That still and luminous mien<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Predicted realms where Time shall be no more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where gladness, like some honey-dew divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Freshens an endless present. Mellitus,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span><span class="i0">From Rome late missioned and the C&oelig;lian Hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made thus his greeting.<br /></span>
<span class="i24">Westward by the Thames<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The King and Bishop paced, and held discourse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of him whose name that huge Cathedral bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Israel's great son, the man of mighty heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The man for her redemption zealous more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than for his proper crown. Not task for her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God gave him: to the Gentiles still he preached,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And won them to the Cross. 'That Faith once spurned,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus cried the Bishop with a kindling eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Lo, how it raised him as on eagle's wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And past the starry gates! The Spirit's Sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He wielded well! Save him who bears the Keys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save him who made confession, "Thou art Christ,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saint Paul had equal none! Hail, Brethren crowned!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hail, happy Rome, that guard'st their mingled dust!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Next spake the Roman of those churches twain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Constantine beside the Tyber built<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To glorify their names. With sudden turn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sebert, the crimson mounting to his brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made question, 'Is your Tyber of the South<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ampler than this, our Thames?' The old man smiled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tyber to Thames is as that willow-stock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To yonder oak.' The Saxon cried with joy:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span><span class="i0">'How true thy judgment is! how just thy tongue!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What hinders, O my Father, but that Thames,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Huge river from the forests rolled by God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should image, like that Tyber, churches twain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Honouring those Princes of the Apostles' Band?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">King Ethelbert, my uncle, built Saint Paul's;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saint Peter's Church be mine!'<br /></span>
<span class="i32">An hour's advance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Left them in thickets tangled. Low the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well-nigh by waters clipt, a savage haunt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With briar and bramble thick, and 'Thorny Isle'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that cause named. Sebert around him gazed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A maiden blush upon him thus he spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'I know this spot; I stood here once, a boy:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas winter then: the swoll'n and turbid flood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rustled the sallows. Far I fled from men:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A youth had done me wrong, and vengeful thoughts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burned in my heart: I warred with them in vain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I prayed against them; yet they still returned:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'erspent at last, I cast me on my knees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cried, "Just God, if Thou despise my prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faithless, thence weak, not less remember well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How many a man in this East Saxon land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stands up this hour, in wood, or field, or farm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like me sore tempted, but with loftier heart:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To these be helpful&mdash;yea, to one of these!"<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span><span class="i0">And lo, the wrathful thoughts, like routed fiends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Left me, and came no more!'<br /></span>
<span class="i28">Discoursing thus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The friends a moment halted in a space<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where stood a flowering thorn. Adown it trailed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In zigzag curves erratic here and there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long lines of milky bloom, like rills of foam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Furrowing the green back of some huge sea wave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Refluent from cliffs. Ecstatic minstrelsy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swelled from its branches. Birds as thick as leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thronged them; and whether joy was theirs that hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because the May had come, or joy of love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or tenderer gladness for their young new-fledged,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So piercing was that harmony, the place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eden to Sebert looked, while brake and bower<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone like the Tree of Life. 'What minster choir,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Bishop cried, 'could better chant God's praise?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here shall your church ascend:&mdash;its altar rise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where yonder thorn tree stands!' The old man spake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet in him lived a thought unbreathed: 'How oft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have trophies risen to blazon deeds accursed!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Angels this church o'er-winging, age on age<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall see that boy at prayer!'<br /></span>
<span class="i32">In peace, in war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Daily the work advanced. The youthful King<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kneeling, himself had raised the earliest sod,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Upon a site to Dian dedicate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now rose its sister. Erring Faith had reached<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In those twin Powers that ruled the Day and Night,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now soared unstained Religion.<br /></span>
<span class="i32">What remained?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Consecration. On its eve, the King<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span><span class="i0">Held revel in its honour, solemn feast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wisely-woven dance, where beauty and youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through loveliest measures moving, music-winged,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And winged not less by gladness, interwreathed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brightness with brightness, glance turned back on glance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smile on smile&mdash;a courtseying graciousness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of stateliest forms that, winding, sank or rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if on heaving seas. In groups apart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old warriors clustered. Eadbald discussed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Snorr, that truce with Wessex signed, and said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Fear nought: it cannot last!' A shadow sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That joyous night upon one brow alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Redwald's, East Anglia's King. In generous youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He, guest that time with royal Ethelbert,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had gladly bowed to Christ. From shallowest soil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faith springs apace, but springs to die. Returned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To plains of Ely, all that sweetness past<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed but a dream while scornful spake his wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon whose brow beauty from love divorced<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made beauty's self unbeauteous: 'Lose&mdash;why not?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thwarting your liegeful subjects, lose at will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your Kingdom; you that might have reigned ere now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bretwalda of the Seven!' In hour accursed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The weak man with his Faith equivocated:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fraudful, beneath the self-same roofs he raised<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span><span class="i0">Altars to Christ and idols. By degrees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Truth he mocked forsook him. Year by year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His face grew dark, and barbed his tongue though smooth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Manner and mind like grass-fields after thaw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silk-soft above, yet iron-hard below:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spleenful that night at Sebert's blithe discourse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He answered thus, with seeming-careless eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wandering from wall to roof:<br /></span>
<span class="i30">'I like your Church:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would it had rested upon firmer ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adorned some airier height: its towers are good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though dark the stone: three quarries white have I;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You might have used them gratis had you willed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Ely, Elmham, and beside the Cam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Felix rears even now his cloistral Schools,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I trust to build three churches soon: my Queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That seconds still my wishes, says, "Beware<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest overhaste, your people still averse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frustrate your high intent." A woman's wit&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet here my wife is wiser than her wont.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I miss your Bishop: grandly countenanced he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save for that mole. He shuns our revel:&mdash;ay!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Monastic virtue never feels secure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save when it skulks in corners!' As he spake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Despite that varnish on his brow clear-cut,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stung by remembrance, from the tutored eye<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span><span class="i0">Forth flashed the fire barbaric: race and heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A moment stood confessed.<br /></span>
<span class="i30">Old Mellitus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That night how fared he? In a fragile tent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Facing that church expectant, low he knelt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the damp ground. More late, like youthful knight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In chapel small watching his arms untried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He kept his consecration vigil still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With hoary hands screening a hoary head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus made prayer: 'Thou God to Whom all worlds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Form one vast temple: Thou Who with Thyself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ritual eterne, dost consecrate <i>that</i> Church,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For aye creating, hallowing it forever;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou Who in narrowest heart of man or child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makest not less Thy dwelling, turn Thine eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To-morrow on our rite. The work we work<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Work it Thyself! Thy storm shall try it well;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Consummate first its strength in righteousness;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So shall beginning just, whate'er befall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or guard it, or restore.'<br /></span>
<span class="i26">So prayed the man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor ever raised his head&mdash;saw nought&mdash;heard nought&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor knew that on the night had come a change,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ill Spirits, belike, whose empire is the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grudging its glories to that pile new raised,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, while they might, assailing. Through the clouds<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span><span class="i0">A panic-stricken moon stumbled and fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wildly on the waters blast on blast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ridged their dark floor. A spring-tide from the sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breasted the flood descending. Woods of Shene<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Hampton's groves had heard that flood all day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more a whisperer soft; and meadow banks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not yet o'er-gazed by Windsor's crested steep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or Reading's tower, had yielded to its wave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blossom and bud. More high, near Oxenford,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Isis and Cherwell with precipitate stream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had swelled the current. Gathering thus its strength<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far off and near, allies and tributaries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That night by London onward rolled the Thames<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beauteous and threatening both.<br /></span>
<span class="i34">Its southern bank<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fronting the church had borne a hamlet long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where fishers dwelt. Upon its verge that night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perplexed the eldest stood: his hand was laid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the gunwale of a stranded boat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His knee was crooked against it. Shrinking still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sad, his eye pursued that racing flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here black like night, dazzled with eddies there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eddies by moonshine glazed. In doubt he mused:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sudden a Stranger by him stood and spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Launch forth, and have no fear.' The fisher gazed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once on his face; and launched. Beside the helm<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span><span class="i0">That Stranger sat. Then lo! a watery lane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before them opening, through the billows curved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Level, like meadow-path. As when a weed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drifts with the tide, so softly o'er that lane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oarless the boat advanced, and instant reached<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The northern shore, dark with that minster's shade;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before them close it frowned.<br /></span>
<span class="i28">'Where now thou stand'st<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abide thou:' thus the Stranger spake: anon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the church's southern gate he stood:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then lo! a marvel. Inward as he passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its threshold crossed, a splendour as of God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth from the bosom of that dusky pile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through all its kindling windows streamed, and blazed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From wave to wave, and spanned that downward tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With many a fiery bridge. The moon was quenched;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all the edges of the headlong clouds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caught up the splendour till the midnight vault<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone like the noon. The fisher knew, that hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That with vast concourse of the Sons of God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That church was thronged; for in it many a head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sun-bright, and hands lifted like hands in prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High up he saw: meantime harmonic strain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As though whatever moves in earth or skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Winds, waters, stars, had joined in one their song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above him floated like a breeze from God<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span><span class="i0">And heaven-born incense. Louder swelled that strain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still the Bride of God, that church late dark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glad of her saintly spousals, laughed and shone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In radiance ever freshening. By degrees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That vision waned. At last the fisher turned:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The matin star shook on the umbered wave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the East there lay a pallid streak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That streak which preludes dawn.<br /></span>
<span class="i34">Beside the man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more that Stranger stood:&mdash;'Seest thou yon tent?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My Brother kneels within it. Thither speed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bid him know I sent thee, speaking thus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"He whom the Christians name 'the Rock' am I:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My Master heard thy prayer: I sought thy church,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sang myself her Consecration rite:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close thou that service with thanksgiving psalm."'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus spake the Stranger, and was seen no more:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But whether o'er the waters, as of old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Footing that Galilean Sea, with faith<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not now infirm he reached the southern shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or passed from sight as one whom crowds conceal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fisher knew not. At the tent arrived,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before its little door he bent, and lo!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within, there knelt a venerable man<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span><span class="i0">With hoary hands screening a hoary head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who prayed, and prayed. His tale the fisher told:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With countenance unamazed, yet well content,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That kneeler answered, 'Son, thy speech is true!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hence, and announce thy tidings to the King,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who leaves his couch but now.'<br /></span>
<span class="i31">'How beautiful'&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That old man sang, as down the Thames at morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In multitudinous pomp the barges dropped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Following those twain that side by side advanced,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One royal, one pontific, bearing each<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Cross in silver blazoned or in gold&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'How beautiful, O Sion, are thy courts!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, on thy brow thy Maker's name is writ:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair is this place and awful; porch of heaven:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold, God's Church is founded on a rock:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It stands, and shall not fall: the gates of Hell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall not prevail against it.'<br /></span>
<span class="i30">From the barge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Sebert and his Queen, antiphonal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rapturous response was wafted: 'I beheld<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jerusalem, the City sage and blest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From heaven I saw it to the earth descending<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sanctity gold-vested, as a Bride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Decked for her Lord. I heard a voice which sang,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold the House where God will dwell with men:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span><span class="i0">And God shall wipe the tears from off their face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And death shall be no more.'<br /></span>
<span class="i32">Old Thames that day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brightened with banners of a thousand boats<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Winnowed by winds flower-scented. Countless hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tossed on the brimming river chaplets wov'n<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On mead or hill, or branches lopped in woods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fruit-bloom red, or white with clustering cone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Changing clear stream to garden. Mile on mile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now song was heard, now bugle horn that died<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gradual 'mid sedge and reed. Alone the swan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High on the western waters kept aloof;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remote she eyed the scene with neck thrown back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her ancient calm preferring, and her haunt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crystalline still. Alone the Julian Tower<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far down the eastern stream, though tap'stries waved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From every window, every roof o'er-swarmed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With anthem-echoing throngs, maintained, unmoved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roman and Stoic, her C√¶sarean pride:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Saxon feasts she fixed a cold, grey gaze;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Mid Christian hymns heard but the old acclaim&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Consul Romanus.'<br /></span>
<span class="i22">When the sun had reached<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its noonday height, a people and its king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around their minster pressed. With measured tread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Introit chanted, up the pillared nave<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span><span class="i0">Reverent they moved: then knelt. Between their ranks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their Bishop last advanced with mitred brow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in his hand the Cross, at every step<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Signing the benediction of his Lord.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The altar steps he mounted. Turning then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Westward his face to that innumerous host,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus spake he unastonished: 'Sirs, ere now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This church's Consecration rite was sung:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be ours to sing thanksgiving to our God,<br /></span>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Eadbald, King of Kent, persecuting the Church, Laurence the Bishop
deems himself the chief of sinners because he has consented, like

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The day was dying on the Kentish downs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the oakwoods by the Stour was dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While sadly shone o'er snowy plains of March<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her comfortless, cold star. The daffodil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That year was past its time. The leaden stream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had waited long that lamp of river-beds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, when the lights of Candlemas are quenched,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looks forth through February mists. A film<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of ice lay brittle on the shallows: dark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swift the central current rushed: the wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sighed through the tawny sedge.<br /></span>
<span class="i32">'So fleets our life&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like yonder gloomy stream; so sighs our age&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span><span class="i0">Like yonder sapless sedge!' Thus Laurence mused<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Standing on that sad margin all alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His twenty years of gladsome English toil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ending at last abortive. 'Stream well-loved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here on thy margin standing saw I first,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My head by chance uplifting from my book,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">King Ethelbert's strong countenance; he is dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, next him, riding through the April gleams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bertha, his Queen, with face so lit by love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its lustre smote the beggar as she passed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And changed his sigh to song. She too is dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And half their thanes that chased the stag that day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like echoes of their own glad bugle-horn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have passed and are not. Why must I abide?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And why must age, querulous and coward both,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Past days lamenting, fear not less that stroke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which makes an end of grief? Base life of man!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How sinks thy slow infection through our bones;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then when you fawned upon us, high-souled youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heroic in its gladness, spurned your gifts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yearning for noble death. In age, in age<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We kiss the hand that nothing holds but dust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Murmuring, "Not yet!"'<br /></span>
<span class="i23">A tear, ere long ice-glazed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hung on the old man's cheek. 'What now remains?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some minutes passed; then, lifting high his head,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span><span class="i0">He answered, 'God remains.' His faith, his heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were unsubverted. 'Twas the weight of grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The exhausted nerve, the warmthless blood of age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That pressed him down like sin, where sin was none&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not sin, but weakness only. Long he mused,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then slowly walked, and feebly, through the woods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Towards his house monastic. Vast it loomed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through ground-fog seen; and vaster, close beside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That convent's church by great Augustine reared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where once old woodlands clasped a temple old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vaunt of false Gods. To Peter and to Paul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That church was dedicate, albeit so long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High o'er the cloudy rack of fleeting years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It bore, and bears, its founder's name, not theirs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therein that holy founder slept in Christ,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Who still, whate'er was named of great or good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made answer, 'Dreams! I say the flesh rules all!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hated the Cross. His Queen, that portent crowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She that with name of wife was yet no wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abhorred that Cross and feared. A Baptist new<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that Herodian court had Laurence stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Commanding, 'Put the evil thing away!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since then the woman's to the monarch's hate<br /></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span><span class="i0">Venoming the serpent's fang. 'Depart the realm!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With voice scarce human thus the tyrant cried,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To clown and boor.<br /></span>
<span class="i19">Upon the bank of Thames<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Frowning into the Christian Church they strode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full-armed, and each, with far-stretched foot firm set<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watching the Christian rite. 'Give us,' they cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While knelt God's children at their Paschal Feast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Give us those circlets of your sacred bread:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye feed therewith your beggars; kings are we!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Bishop answered, 'Be, like them, baptized,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sons of God's Church, His Sacrament with man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that cause Mother of Christ's Sacraments,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So shall ye share her Feast.' With lightning speed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their swords leaped forth; contemptuous next they cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'For once we spare to sweep a witless head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From worthless shoulders. Ere to-morrow's dawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hence, nor return!' He sped to Rochester:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her bishop, like himself, was under ban:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The twain to Canterbury passed, and there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resolved to let the tempest waste its wrath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And crossed the seas. By urgency outworn,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span><span class="i0">'Gainst that high judgment of his holier will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laurence to theirs deferred, but tarried yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For one day more to cast a last regard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On regions loved so long.<br /></span>
<span class="i28">As compline ceased<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He reached the abbey gates, and entered in:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sadly the brethren looked him in the face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet no one said, 'Take comfort!' Sad and sole<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He passed to the Scriptorium: round he gazed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thought of happy days, when Gregory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One time their Abbot, next their Pope, would send<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some precious volume to his exiled sons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While they in reverence knelt, and kissed its edge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, kissing, heard once more, as if in dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gregorian chants through Roman palm trees borne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With echoes from the Coliseum's wall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adown that C&oelig;lian Hill; and saw God's poor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At feast around that humble board which graced<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That palace senatorial once. He stood:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He raised a casket from an open chest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from that casket drew a blazoned scroll,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And placed it on the window-sill up-sloped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breast-high, and faintly warmed by sinking sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then o'er it bent a space.<br /></span>
<span class="i28">With sudden hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old man raised that scroll; aloud he read:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span><span class="i0">'I, Ethelbert the King, and all my Thanes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Honouring the Apostle Peter, cede to God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This Abbey and its lands. If heir of mine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cancel that gift, when Christ with angels girt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makes way to judge the Nations of this world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His name be cancelled from the Book of Life.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old man paused; then read the signatures,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'I, Ethelbert, of Kent the King.' Who next?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'I, Eadbald, his son;' to these succeeding,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'I, Hennigisil, Duke;' 'I, Hocca, Earl.'&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Can such things be?' Around the old man's brow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The veins swelled out; dilated nostril, mouth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Working as mouth of him that tasteth death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With what beside is wiselier unrevealed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Witnessed that agony which spake no more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He dashed the charter on the pavement down;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then on it gazed a space.<br /></span>
<span class="i30">Remembering soon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose name stood first on that dishonoured list,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Contrite he raised that charter to his breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pressed it there in silence. Hours went by;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then dark was all that room, and dark around<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The windy corridors and courts stone-paved;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bitter blew the blast: his unlooped cloak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell loose: the cold he noted not. At last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A brother passed the door with lamp in hand:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span><span class="i0">Dazzled, he started first: then meekly spake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Beseech the brethren that they strew my bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the church. Until the second watch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There must I fast, and pray,'<br /></span>
<span class="i30">The brethren heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strewed his couch within the vast, void nave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mat and deer-skin, and, more high, that stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old head's nightly pillow. Echoes faint<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere long of their receding footsteps died<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While from the dark fringe of a rainy cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An ice-cold moon, ascending, streaked the church<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With gleam and gloom alternate. On his knees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime that aged priest was creeping slow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From stone to stone, as when on battle-plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The battle lost, some warrior wounded sore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By all forsaken, or some war-horse maimed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drags a blind bulk along the field in search<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of thirst-assuaging spring. Glittered serene<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That light before the Sacrament of Love:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thither he bent his way, and long time prayed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thence onward crept to where King Ethelbert<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slept, marble-shrined&mdash;his ashes, not the King,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet ashes kingly since God's temple once,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And waiting God's great day. Before that tomb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself as rigid, with lean arms outspread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus made the man his moan:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span><span class="i32">'King Ethelbert!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hear'st thou in glory? Ofttimes on thy knees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou mad'st confession of thine earthly sins<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To me, a wounded worm this day on earth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now comforted art thou, and I brought low:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, though I see no more that beaming front,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And haply for my sins may see it never,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet inwardly I gladden, knowing this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou art glad. Perchance thou hear'st me not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thou wert still a heedless man of mirth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though sage as strong at need. If this were so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not less thy God would hear my prayer to thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grant it in thy reverence. Ethelbert!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou hadst thy trial time, since, many a year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All shepherdless thy well-loved people strayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What time thyself, their shepherd, knew'st not Christ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sole shepherd of man's race. King Ethelbert!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rememberest thou that day in Thanet Isle?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That day the Bride of God on English shores<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Set her pure foot; and thou didst kneel to kiss it:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou gav'st her meat and drink in kingly wise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gav'st her thy palace for her bridal bower;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This Abbey build'dst&mdash;her fortress! O those days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crowned with such glories, with such sweetness winged!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou saw'st thy realm made one with Christ's: thou saw'st<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span><span class="i0">Thy race like angels ranging courts of Heaven:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This day, behold, thou seest the things thou seest!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If there be any hope, King Ethelbert,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Help us this day with God!'<br /></span>
<span class="i30">Upon his knees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then crept that exile old to Bertha's tomb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there made moan: 'Thou tenderest Queen and sweetest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom no man ever gazed on save with joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or spake of, dead, save weeping! Well I know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That on thee in thy cradle Mary flung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lily whiter from her hand, a rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warm from her breath and breast, for all thy life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was made of Chastities and Charities&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This hour thine eyes are on that Vision bent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereof the radiance, ere by thee beheld,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave thee thine earthly brightness. Mirrored there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seest thou, like moat in sunbeam well-nigh lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our world of temporal anguish? See it not!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For He alone, the essential Peace Eterne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could see it unperturbed. In Him rejoice!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, 'mid thy heavenly triumph, plead, O plead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For hearts that break below!'<br /></span>
<span class="i31">Upon the ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Awhile that man sore tried his forehead bowed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then raised it till the frore and foggy beam<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span><span class="i0">Mixed with his wintry hair. Once more he crept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon his knees through shadow; reached at length<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His toilsome travel's last and dearest bourn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The grave of Saint Augustine. O'er it lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Patriarch's statued semblance as in sleep:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knew it well, and found it, though to him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In darkness lost and veil beside of tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With level hands grazing those upward feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft kissed, yet ne'er as now.<br /></span>
<span class="i30">'Farewell forever!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Farewell, my Master, and farewell, my friend!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since ever thou in heaven abid'st&mdash;and I&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gregory the Pontiff from that Roman Hill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sent thee to work a man's work far away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And manlike didst thou work it. Prince, yet child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men saw thee, and obeyed thee. O'er the earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy step was regal, meekness of thy Christ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weighted with weight of conquerors and of kings:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men saw a man who toiled not for himself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet never ceased from toil; who warred on Sin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had peace with all beside. In happy hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God laid His holy hand upon thine eyes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I knelt beside thy bed: I leaned mine ear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down to thy lips to catch their last; in vain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet thou perchance wert murmuring in thy heart:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I leave my staff within no hireling's hand;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span><span class="i0">Therefore my work shall last," Ah me! Ah me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was a Laurence once on Afric's shore:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He with his Cyprian died. I too, methinks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had shared&mdash;how gladly shared&mdash;my Bishop's doom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Father, with Gregory pray this night! That God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who promised, "for my servant David's sake,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even yet may hear thy prayer.'<br /></span>
<span class="i32">Thus wept the man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till o'er him fell half slumber. Soon he woke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, from between that statue's marble feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifting a marble face, in silence crept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To where far off his bed was strewn, and drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deer-skin covering o'er him. With its warmth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep sleep, that solace of lamenting hearts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which makes the waking bitterer, o'er him sank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor wholly left him, though in sleep he moaned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When from the neighbouring farm, an hour ere dawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The second time rang out that clarion voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which bids the Christian watch.<br /></span>
<span class="i34">As thus he lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">T'wards him there moved in visions of the Lord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Venerable Shape, compact of light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And loftier than our mortal. Near arrived,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That mild, compassionate Splendour shrank his beam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or healed with strengthening touch the gazer's eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made worthier of such grace; and Laurence saw<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span><span class="i0">Princedom not less than his, the Apostles' Chief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To whom the Saviour answered, 'Rock art thou,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And later&mdash;crowning Love, not less than Faith&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Feed thou My Sheep, My Lambs!' He knew that shape,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For oft, a child 'mid catacombs of Rome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And winding ways girt by the martyred dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His eyes had seen it. Pictured on those vaults<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood Peter, Moses of the Christian Law,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Figured in one that by the Burning Bush<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unsandalled knelt, or drew with lifted hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The torrent from the rock, yet wore not less<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In aureole round his head the Apostle's name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Petros,' and in his hand sustained the Keys&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such shape once more he saw.<br /></span>
<span class="i29">'And comest thou then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long-waited, or with sceptre-wielding hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earthward to smite the unworthiest head on earth,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Him from the synod of the Saints to shut<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who fled as flies the hireling? Let it be!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not less in that bright City by whose gate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warder thou sitt'st, my Master thou shalt see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pacing the diamond terraces of God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bastions jacinth-veined, my great Augustine,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But in the on-sweeping centuries thrice or twice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These three may name my name?' He spake and wept.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To whom the Apostolic Splendour thus:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Live, and be strong: for those thou lovest in Christ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not only in far years shall name thy name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This day be sure that name they name in Christ:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Else wherefore am I here? Not thou alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Much more in grief's bewilderment than fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hast from the right way swerved. Was I not strong?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, from the first Elect, and named anew?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I who received, at first, divine command<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Brother-band to strengthen; last to rule?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I who to Hebrew and to Gentile both<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flung wide the portals of the heavenly realm?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was I not strong? Behold, thou know'st my fall!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A second fall was near. At Rome the sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against me raged. Forth by the Appian Way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I fled; and, past the gateway, face to face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him met, Who up the steep of Calvary, bare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For man's behoof the Cross. "Where goest thou, Lord?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I spake; then He: "I go to Rome, once more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To die for him who fears for me to die."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span><span class="i0">To Rome returned I; and my end was peace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Return thou too. Thy brethren have not sinned:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They fled, consentient with the Will Supreme:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their names are written in the Book of Life:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enough that He Who gives to each his part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath sealed thy sons and thee to loftier fates;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore more sternly tries. Be strong; be glad:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For strength from joyance comes.'<br /></span>
<span class="i34">The Vision passed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old man, seated on his narrow bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rolled thrice his eyes around the vast, dim church,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Desiring to retain it. Vain the quest!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet still within his heart that Radiance lived:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sweetness of that countenance fresh from God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would not be dispossessed, but kindled there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Memorial dawn of brightness, more and more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Growing to perfect day: inviolate peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such peace as heavenly visitants bequeath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er-spread his spirit, gradual, like a sea:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth from the bosom of that peace upsoared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hope, starry-crowned, and winged, that liberates oft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faith, unextinct, though bound by Powers accursed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That o'er her plant the foot, and hold the chain&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Terror and Sloth. To noble spirits set free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Delight means gratitude. Thus Laurence joyed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But soon, remembering that unworthy past,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span><span class="i0">Remorse succeeded, sorrow born of love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Consoled by love alone. 'Ah! slave,' he cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, serving such a God, could'st dream of flight:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How many a babe, too weak to lift his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is strong enough to die!' While thus he mused<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The day-dawn reaching to his pallet showed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Discipline, wire-woven, in ancient days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Guest of monastic bed. He snatched it thence:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around his bending neck and shoulders lean<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In dire revenge he hurled it. Spent at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though late, those bleeding hands down dropped: the cheek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sank on the stony pillow. Little birds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Low-chirping ere their songs began, attuned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slumber unbroken. In a single hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He slept a long night's sleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i30">The rising sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Woke him: but in his heart another sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New-risen serene with healing on its wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Outshone that sun in brightness. 'Mid the choir<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His voice was loudest while they chanted lauds:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brother to brother whispered, issuing forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'He walks in stature higher by a head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than in the month gone by!'<br /></span>
<span class="i30">That day at noon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">King Eadwald, intent to whiten theft<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Girt by his warriors and his Witena,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enthron√®d sat. 'What boots it?' laughed a thane;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Laurence has fled! we battle with dead men!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Ay, ay,' the King replied, 'I told you oft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sages can brag; your dreamer weaves his dream:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But honest flesh rules all!' While thus they spake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confusion filled the hall: through guarded gates<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A priest advanced with mitre and with Cross,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A monk that seemed not monk, but prince disguised:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was Saint Laurence. As he neared the throne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fashion of the tyrant's face was changed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Dar'st thou?' he cried, 'I deemed thee fled the realm&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What seek'st thou here?' The Saint made answer, 'Death.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calmly he told his tale; then ended thus:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'To me that sinful past is sin of one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Buried in years gone by. All else is dream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save that last look the Apostle on me bent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere from my sight he ceased. I saw therein<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The reflex of that wondrous last Regard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cast by the sentenced Saviour of mankind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On one who had denied Him, standing cold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the High Priest's gate. Like him, I wept;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His countenance wrought my penance, not his hand:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I scarcely felt the scourge.'<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span><span class="i30">King Eadbald<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drave back the sword half drawn, and round him stared;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">'Ulf! Kathnar! Strip his shoulders bare! If true<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His tale, the brand remains!'<br /></span>
<span class="i30">Two chiefs stepped forth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They dragged with trembling hand, and many a pause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The external garb pontific first removed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dark, blood-stained garment from the bleeding flesh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old man kneeling. Once, and only once,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The monarch gazed on that disastrous sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Muttering, 'and yet he lives!' A time it was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of swift transitions. Hearts, how proud soe'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made not that boast&mdash;consistency in sin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though dark and rough accessible to Grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As earth to vernal showers. With hands hard-clenched<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The King upstarted: thus his voice rang out:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Beware, who gave ill counsel to their King!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The royal countenance is against them set,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ill merchants trafficking with his lesser moods!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does any say the King wrought well of late,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warring on Christ, and chasing hence his priests?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The man that lies shall die! This day, once more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I ratify my Father's oath, and mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To keep the Church in peace: and though I sware<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To push God's monks from yonder monastery<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span><span class="i0">And lodge therein the horses of the Queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those horses, and the ill-persuading Queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall flee my kingdom, and the monks abide!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brave work ye worked, my loose-kneed Witena,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This day, Christ's portion yielding to my wrath!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See how I prize your labours!' With his sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He clave the red seal from their statute scroll<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stamped it under foot. Once more he spake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gazing with lion gaze from man to man:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'The man that, since my Father, Ethelbert,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though monarch, stooped to common doom of men,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">May-breeze returns, and bud-releasing breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When hoped the least:&mdash;'tis thus with royal minds!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spake: from that day forth in Canterbury<br /></span>

<span class="i0">God's Church had rest. In many a Saxon realm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Convulsion rocked her cradle: altars raised<br /></span>

<span class="i0">One half the mighty Roman work, and more,<br /></span>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Sigebert, King of East Anglia, moved by what he has heard from a
Christian priest, consults the Prophetess Heida. In the doctrine he
reports Heida recognises certain sacred traditions from the East,
originally included in the Northern religion, and affirms that the
new Faith is the fulfilment of the great Volusp√† prophecy, the
earliest record of that religion, which foretold the destruction
both of the Odin-Gods and the Giant race, the restoration of all
things, and the reign of Love. </p></div>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Long time upon the late-closed door the King<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kept his eyes fixed. The wondrous guest was gone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, seeing that his words were great and sage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Compassionate for the sorrowful state of man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet sparing not man's sin, their echoes lived<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrilling large chambers in the monarch's breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silent for many a year. Exiled in France<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mystery of the Faith had reached his ear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In word but not in power. The westering sun<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span><span class="i0">Lengthened upon the palace floor its beam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet the strong hand which propped that thoughtful head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sank not, nor moved. Sudden, King Sigebert<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arose and spake: 'I go to Heida's Tower:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Await ye my return.'<br /></span>
<span class="i22">The woods ere long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around him closed. Upon the wintry boughs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An iron shadow pressed; and as the wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Increased beneath their roofs, an iron sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clangoured funereal. Down their gloomiest aisle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With snow flakes white, the monarch strode, till now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before him, and not distant, Heida's Tower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Prophetess by all men feared yet loved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smit by a cold beam from the yellowing west,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone like a tower of brass. Her ravens twain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crested the turrets of its frowning gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unwatched by warder. Sigebert passed in:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the stony vault the queenly Seer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sat on her ebon throne.<br /></span>
<span class="i26">With pallid lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The King rehearsed his tale; how one with brow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lordlier than man's, and visionary eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, wander where they might, saw Spirits still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had told him many marvels of some God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mightier than Odin thrice. He paused awhile:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A warning shadow came to Heida's brow:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span><span class="i0">Nathless she nothing spake. The King resumed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'He spake&mdash;that stranger&mdash;of the things he saw:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he, his body tranced, it may be dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In spirit oft hath walked the Spirit-Land:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thence, downward gazing, once he saw our earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little vale obscure, and, o'er it hung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those four great Fires that desolate mankind:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Fire of Falsehood first; the Fire of Lust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ravening for weeds and scum; the Fire of Hate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hurling, on war-fields, brother-man 'gainst man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Fire of tyrannous Pride. While yet he gazed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold, those Fires, widening, commixed, then soared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Threatening the skies. A Spirit near him cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Fear nought; for breeze-like pass the flames o'er him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In whom they won no mastery there below:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But woe to those who, charioted therein,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rode forth triumphant o'er the necks of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And had their day on earth. Proportioned flames<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of other edge shall try their work and them!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus spake my guest: the frost wind smote his brows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While on that moonlit crag we sat, ice-cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet down them, like the reaper's sweat at noon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The drops of anguish streamed. Till then, methinks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thing Sin is I knew not.<br /></span>
<span class="i30">Calm of voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again he spake. He told me of his God:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span><span class="i0">That God, like Odin, is a God of War:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who serve Him wear His armour day and night:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The maiden, nay, the child, must wield the sword;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet none may hate his neighbour. Thus he spake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Prophet from far regions: "Wherefore wreck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy brother man? upon his innocent babes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drag down the ruinous roof? Seek manlier tasks!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The death in battle is the easiest death:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be yours the daily dying; lifelong death;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death of the body that the soul may live:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">War on the Spirits unnumbered and accurst<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, rulers of the darkness of this world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drive, hour by hour, their lances through man's soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That wits not of the wounding!"'<br /></span>
<span class="i32">Heida turned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A keen eye on the King: 'Whence came your guest?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not from those sun-bright southern shores, I ween?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He answered, 'Nay, from western isle remote<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Prophet came.' Then Heida's countenance fell:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'The West! the West! it should have been the East!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conclude your tale: what saith your guest of God?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The King replied: 'His God so loved mankind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, God remaining, he became a man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So hated sin that, sin to slay, He died.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One tear of His had paid the dreadful debt:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not so He willed it: thus He willed, to wake<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span><span class="i0">In man, His lost one, quenchless hate of sin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proportioned to the death-pang of a God;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor chose He lonely majesty of death:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twixt sinners paired He died.'<br /></span>
<span class="i32">In Heida's eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trembled a tear. 'A dream was mine in youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When first the rose of girlhood warmed my cheek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dream of some great Sacrifice that claimed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not praise&mdash;not praise&mdash;it only yearned to die<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Helping the Loved. A maid alone, I thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such sacrifice could offer.' As she spake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She pressed upon the pale cheek, warmed once more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her cold, thin hand a moment.<br /></span>
<span class="i31">'Maiden-born<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was He, my guest revealed,' the King replied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Then from that Angel's "Hail," and her response,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"So be it unto me," when sinless doubt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vanished in world-renewing, free consent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He told the tale;&mdash;the Infant in the crib;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shepherds o'er him bowed;' (with widening eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heida, bent forward, saw like them that Child)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'The Star that led the Magians from the East&mdash;&mdash;'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'The East, the East! It should have been the East!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more she cried; 'our race is from the East:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Persian worshipped t'ward the rising sun:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You said, but now, the West.' The King resumed:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span><span class="i0">'God's priest was from the West; but in the East<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The great Deliverer sprang.' Next, step by step,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like herald panting forth in leaguered town<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tidings unhoped for of deliverance strange<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through victory on some battle field remote,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The King rehearsed his theme, from that first Word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'The Woman's Seed shall bruise the Serpent's head,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prime Gospel, ne'er forgotten in the East,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Calvary's Cross, the Resurrection morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lastly the great Ascension into heaven:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ever as he spake on Heida's cheek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The red spot, deepening, spread; within her eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An unastonished gladness waxed more large:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back to the marble woman came her youth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more within her heaving breast it lived,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more upon her forehead shone, as when<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The after-glow returns to Alpine snows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Left death-like by dead day. Question at times<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She made, yet seemed the answer to foreknow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That tale complete, low-toned at last she spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Unhappy they to whom these things are hard!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then silent sat, and by degrees became<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more that dreaded prophet, stern and cold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The silence deeper grew: the sun, not set,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had sunk beneath the forest's western ridge;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And jagged shadows tinged that stony floor<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span><span class="i0">Whereon the monarch knelt. Slowly therefrom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He raised his head; then slowly made demand:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Is he apostate who discards old Faith?'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Long time in musings Heida sat, then spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Yea, if that Faith discarded be the Truth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not so, if it be falsehood. God is Truth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God-taught, true hearts discern that Truth, and guard:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom God forsakes forsake it. O thou North,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That beat'st thy brand so loud against thy shield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hearing nought else, what Truth one day was thine!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold within corruption's charnel vaults<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It sleeps this day. What God shall lift its head?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We came from regions of the rising sun:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scorning the temples built by mortal hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We worshipp'd God&mdash;one God&mdash;the Immense, All-Just:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That worship was the worship of great hearts:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Duty was worship then: that God received it:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know not if benignly He received;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If God be Love I know not. This I know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God loves not priest that under roofs of gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifts, in his right hand held, the Sacrifice;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The left, behind him, fingering for the dole.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">King of East Anglia's realm, the primal Truths<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are vanished from our Faith: the ensanguined rite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The insane carouse survive!'<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span><span class="i28">Thus Heida spake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heida, the strong one by the strong ones feared;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heida, the sad one by the mourners loved;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heida, the brooder on the sacred Past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nursling of a Prophet House, the child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of old traditions sage!<br /></span>
<span class="i24">She paused, and then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Milder, resumed: 'What moved thee to believe?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Sigebert made answer thus: 'The Sword:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For as a sword that Truth the stranger preached<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ran down into my heart.' Heida to him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Well saidst thou "as a Sword:" a Sword is Truth;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As sharp a sword is Love: and many a time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In youth, but not the earliest, happiest youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When first I found that grief was in the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had learned how deep its root, an infant's wail<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went through me like a sword. Man's cry it seemed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blindfold, crown√®d creature's cry for Truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His spirit's sole deliverer.'<br /></span>
<span class="i28">Once again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She mused, and then continued, 'Truth and Love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are gifts too great to give themselves for nought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exacting Gods. Within man's bleeding heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If e'er to man conceded, both shall lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crossed, like two swords&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span><span class="i0">Behold thine image, crowned Humanity!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Better such dower than life exempt from woe:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our Fathers knew to suffer; joyed in pain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They knew not this&mdash;how deep its root!'<br /></span>
<span class="i40">Once more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Prophetess was mute: again she spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'How named thy guest his God?' The King replied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'The Warrior God, Who comes to judge the world;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Lord of Love; the God Who wars on Sin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ceases not to war.' 'Ay, militant,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heida rejoined, with eyes that shone like stars:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'The Persian knew Him. Ormuzd was His name:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unpitying Light against the darkness warred;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Betrayed no passion of a soul perturbed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Austere it was; not wrathful; these her words:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Son, as I hearkened to thy tale this day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Memory returned to me of visions three<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That lighted three great junctures of my life:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thrice thy words were echoes strange of words<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span><span class="i0">That shook my tender childhood, slumbering half,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half-waked by matin beams&mdash;"The Gods must die."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three times that awful sound was in mine ear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Later I learned that voice was nothing new.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My Son, the earliest record of our Faith,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So sacred that on Runic stave or stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None dared to grave it, lore from age to age<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Transmitted by white lips of trembling seers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spared not to wing, like arrow sped from God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That word to man, "Valhalla's Gods must die!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Gods and Giant Race that strove so long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Met in their last and mightiest battle field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must die, and die one death. That prophet-voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Gods have heard. Therefore they daily swell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Valhalla's Hall with heroes rapt from earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To aid them in that fight.'<br /></span>
<span class="i30">On Heida's face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last the King, his head uplifting, gazed:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There where the inviolate calm had dwelt alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A million thoughts, each following each, on swept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That calm beneath them still, as when some grove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er-run by sudden gust of summer storm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With inly-working panic thrills at first,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then springs to meet the gale, while o'er it rush<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shadows with splendours mixed. Upon her breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came down the fire divine. With lifted hands<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span><span class="i0">She stood: she sang a death-song centuries old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dirge prophetic both of Gods and men:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">'The iron age shall make an iron end:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The men who lived in hate, or impious love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall meet in one red battle field. That day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The forests of the earth, blackening, shall die;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stars down-fall; the Wing√®d Hound of Heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That chased the Sun from age to age, shall close<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er it at last; the Ash Tree, Ygdrasil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose boughs o'er-roof the skies, whose roots descend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Hell, whose leaves are lives of men, whose boughs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The destined empires that o'er-awe the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall drop its fruit unripe. The Midgard Snake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Circling that sea which girds the orb of earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall wake, and turn, and ocean in one wave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er-sweep all lands. Thereon shall Naglfar ride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The skeleton ship all ribbed with bones of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose sails are woven of night, and by whose helm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stand the Three Fates. When heaves that ship in sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then know the end draws nigh.'<br /></span>
<span class="i30">She ceased; then spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'If any doubt, the Volusp√† tells all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The song the mystic maiden, Vola, sang;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our first of prophets she, as I the last:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She sang that song no Prophet dared to write.'<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span><span class="i2">But Sigebert made answer where he knelt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Faith back rushing blindly on his heart:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Though man's last nation lay a wreath of dust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though earth were sea, not less in heaven the Gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would hold their revels still; Valhalla's Halls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resound the heroes' triumph!'<br /></span>
<span class="i32">Once again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heida arose: once more her pallid face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone lightning-like, wan cheeks and flashing eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more she sang: 'The Warder of the Gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soundeth the Gjallar Trumpet, never heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before by Gods or mortals: from their feast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The everlasting synod of the Gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rush forth, gold-armed, with chariot and with horse:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First rides the Father of the flock divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Odin, our King, and, at his right hand, Thor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose thunder hammer splits the mountain crags<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And level lays the summits of the world;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heimdall and Bragi, Uller, Njord, and Tyr,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind them throng; with these the concourse huge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of lesser Gods, and Heroes snatched from earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since man's first battle, part to bear with Gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this their greatest. From their halls of ice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To meet them stride the mighty Giant-Brood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moving mountains of old J√∂tunheim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strong with all strengths of Nature, flood or fire,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span><span class="i0">Glacier, or stream volcanic from red hills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cutting through grass-green billows;&mdash;on they throng<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Topping the clouds, and, leagues before them, flinging<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Huge shade, like shade of mountains cast o'er wastes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When sets the sun.' A little time she ceased;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then fiercelier sang: 'Flanking that Giant-Brood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I see two Portents, terrible as Sin:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Midgard Snake primeval at the right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With demon-crest as haughtily upheaved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As though all ocean curled into one wave:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A million rainbows braid that glooming arch;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Death therein is mirrored. At the left,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On moves that brother Terror, wolf in shape,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, bound till now by craft of prescient Gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weltered in Hell's abyss. Till came the hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A single hair inwoven by heavenly hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sufficed to chain that monster to his rock;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His fast is over now; his dusky jaws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last the Eternal Hunger lifts distent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As far as heaven from earth.'<br /></span>
<span class="i28">The Prophetess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One moment pressed her palms upon her eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then flung them wide. 'The Father of the Gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our Odin, at that Portent hurls his lance;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Thor, though bleeding fast, with hammer raised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deals with that Serpent's scales.'<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span><span class="i36">'The Gods shall win,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shouted the King, forgetting at that hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All save the strife, while on his brow there burned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hue of the battle at the battle's height<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When no man staunches wound. With voice serene<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(The storm had left her) Heida made reply:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'If any doubt, the Volusp√† tells all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere yet Valhalla's lower heaven was shaped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Muspell, the great Third Heaven immeasurable,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above it towered, throne of that God Supreme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who knew beginning none, and knows no end:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High on its southern cliff that dread One sits,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor ever from the South withdraws His gaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor ever drops that bright, sky-pointing Sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose splendour dims the noontide sun. That God&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He, and the Spirit-Host that wing His light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When shines the Judgment Sign, shall stand on earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And judge the earth with fire. Nor men nor Gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall face that fire and live.'<br /></span>
<span class="i32">As Heida spake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The broad full moon above the forest soared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And changed her form to light. With hands out-stretched<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She sang her last of songs: 'The Hour is come:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bifrost, the rainbow-bridge 'twixt heaven and earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shatters; the crystal walls of heaven roll in:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the ruins ride the Sons of Light.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span><span class="i0">That dread One first&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth from His helm the intolerable beam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strikes to the battle-field; the Giant-Brood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Die in that flame; and Odin, and his Gods:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Valhalla falls, and with it J√∂tunheim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its ice-piled mountains melting into waves:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fire are all things lost!'<br /></span>
<span class="i30">Then wept the King:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Alas for Odin and his brethren Gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in their great hands stayed the northern land!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas for man!' But Heida, with fixed face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereon there sat its ancient calm, replied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Nothing that lived but shall again have life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such life as virtue claims. Ill-working men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Loki and with Hela, evil Gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall dwell far down in N√°str√∂nd's death-black pile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Compact of serpent scales, whose thousand gates<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Face to the North, blinded by endless storm:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But from the sea shall rise a happier earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holier and happier. There the good and true<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secure shall gladden, and the fiery flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Harm them no more. Another Asgard there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where stood that earlier, ere our fathers left<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their native East, shall lift sublimer towers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dawn-lighted by a loftier Ararat:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just men and pure shall pace its palmy steeps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With him of race divine yet human heart,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span><span class="i0">Baldur, upon whose beaming front the Gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gazing, exulted; from whose lips mankind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall gather counsel. Hand in hand with him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall stand the blind God, H√∂dur, now not blind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, witless, slew him with the mistletoe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet loved him well. Others, both men and Gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That dread Third Heaven attained, shall make abode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Him Who ever is, and ever was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enthroned like Him upon its southern cliff,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drinking the light immortal. From beneath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like winds from flowery wildernesses borne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The breath of all good deeds and virtuous thoughts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their own, or others', since the worlds were made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All generous sufferings, o'er their hearts shall hang,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fragrance perpetual; and, where'er they gaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Vision of their God shall on them shine.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Thus Heida spake, and ceased; then added, 'Son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our Faith shall never suffer wreck: fear nought!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fulfilment, not Destruction, is its end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thou return, and bid thy herald guest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who sought thee, wandering from his westward Isle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Approach my gates at dawn, and in mine ear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Divulge his message to this land. Farewell!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Then from his knees the monarch rose, and took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the huge moonlit woods his homeward way.<br /></span>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Sigebert, King of Essex, labours with Cedd the Bishop for the
conversion of his people; but he feasts with a certain impious
kinsman; and it is foretold to him that for that sin, though
pardoned, he shall die by that kinsman's hand. This prophecy having
been accomplished, Cedd betakes himself to Lastingham, there to
pray with his three brothers for the king's soul. His prayer is
heard, and in a few days he dies. Thirty of Cedd's monks, issuing
from Essex to pray at his grave, die also, and are buried in a
circle round it. </p></div>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'At last resolve, my brother, and my friend!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fling from you, as I fling this cloak, your Gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cleave to Him, the Eternal, One and Sole,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The All-Wise, All-Righteous and Illimitable,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who made us, and will judge.' Thus Oswy spake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Sigebert, his friend, of Essex King,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Essex once Christian. Royal Sebert dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Church of God had sorrow by the Thames:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three Pagan brothers in his place held sway:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They warred upon God's people; for which cause<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span><span class="i0">God warred on them, and by the Wessex sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In one day hewed them down. King Sigebert,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Throned in their place, to Oswy thus replied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'O friend, I saw the Truth, yet saw it not!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas like the light forth flashed from distant oar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now vivid, vanished now. Not less, methinks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy Christ ere now had won me save for this;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I feared that in my bosom love for thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not Truth alone, prevailed. I left thy court;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I counselled with my wisest; by degrees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though grieving thus to outrage loyal hearts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reached my resolve: henceforth I serve thy God:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My kingdom may renounce me if it will.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then came the Bishop old, and nigh that Wall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which spans the northern land from sea to sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Baptized him to the God Triune. At night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The King addressed him thus: 'My task is hard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yield me four priests of thine from Holy Isle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shape my courses.' Finan gazed around<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made election&mdash;Cedd and others three;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He consecrated Cedd with staff and ring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by the morning's sunrise Sigebert<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rode with them, face to south.<br /></span>
<span class="i30">The Spring, long checked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell, like God's Grace, or fire, or flood, at once<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er all the land: it swathed the hills in green;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span><span class="i0">It fringed with violets cleft and rock; illumed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stream with primrose tufts: but mightier far<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Spring which triumphed in the monarch's breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All doubt dispelled. That smile which knew not cause<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked like his angel's mirrored on his face:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At times he seemed with utter gladness dazed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At times he laughed aloud. 'Father,' he cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'That darkness from my spirit is raised at last:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah fool! ah fool! to wait for proof so long!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unseal thine eyes, and all things speak of God:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The snows on yonder thorn His pureness show;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yon golden iris bank His love. But now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I marked a child that by its father ran:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some mystery they seemed of love in heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Imaged in earthly love. 'With sad, sweet smile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old man answered: 'Pain there is on earth&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bereavement, sickness, death.' The King replied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'It was by suffering, not by deed, or word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God's Son redeemed mankind.' Then answered Cedd:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'God hath thee in His net; and well art thou!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Truth thou seest this day, and feelest, live!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So shall it live within thee. If, more late,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rebuke should come, or age, remember then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This day-spring of thy strength, and answer thus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"With me God feasted in my day of youth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So feast He now with others!"'<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span><span class="i30">Years went by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Cedd in work and word was mighty still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And throve with God. The strong East Saxon race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grew gentle in his presence: they were brave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And faith is courage in the things divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Courage with meekness blent. The heroic heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beats to the spiritual cognate, paltering not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fraudulent with truth once known. Like winds from God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God's message on them fell. Old bonds of sin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Snapt by the vastness of the growing soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burst of themselves; and in the heart late bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Virtue had room to breathe. As when that Voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Primeval o'er the formless chaos rolled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, straight, confusions ceased, the greater orb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ruling the day, the lesser, night; even so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Born of that Bethlehem Mystery, order lived:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Divine commandments fixed a firmament<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt man's lower instincts and his mind:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From unsuspected summits of his spirit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The morning shone. The nation with the man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Partook the joy: from duty freedom flowed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there where tribes had roved a people lived.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pathos of strange beauty hung thenceforth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er humblest hamlet: he who passed it prayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'May never sword come here!' Bishop and King<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span><span class="i0">Together laboured: well that Bishop's love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Repaid that royal zeal. If random speech<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Censured the King, though justly, sudden red<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Circling the old man's silver-tress√®d brow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Showed, though he spake not, that in saintly breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The human heart lived on.<br /></span>
<span class="i26">In Ithancester<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He dwelt, and toiled: not less to Lindisfarne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His ancient home, in spirit oft he yearned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Longing for converse with his God alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made retreat there often, not to shun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Labour allotted, but to draw from heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strength for his task. One year, returning thence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">D√´ira's King addressed him as they rode:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'My father, choose the richest of my lands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And build thereon a holy monastery;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So shall my realm be blessed, and I, and mine.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He answered: 'Son, no wealthy lands for us!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spake not the prophet: "There where dragons roamed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In later days the grass shall grow&mdash;the reed"?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I choose those rocky hills that, on our left,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drag down the skiey waters to the woods:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such loved I from my youth: to me they said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Bandits this hour usurp our heights, and beasts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cumber our caves: expel the seed accurst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yield us back to God!"'<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span><span class="i28">The King gave ear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Cedd within those mountains passed his Lent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Driving with prayer and fast the spirits accurst<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With ignominy forth. Foundations next<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He laid with sacred pomp. Fair rose the walls:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All day the March sea blew its thunder blasts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through wide-mouthed trumpets of ravine or rift<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On winding far to where in wooden cell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old man prayed, while o'er him rushed the cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Storm-borne from crag to crag. Serener breeze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With alternation soft in Nature's course,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Following ere long, great Easter's harbinger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus spake he: 'I must keep the Feast at home;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My children there expect me.' Parting thence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He left his brothers three to consummate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His work begun, Celin, and Cynabil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Chad, at Lichfield Bishop ere he died.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus Lastingham had birth.<br /></span>
<span class="i28">Beside the Thames<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime dark deeds were done. There dwelt two thanes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The kinsmen of the King, his friends in youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of meanest friend unworthy. Far and wide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They ravined, and the laws of God and man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Despised alike. Three times, in days gone by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A warning hand their Bishop o'er them raised;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fourth like bolt from heaven on them it fell,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span><span class="i0">And clave them from God's Church. They heeded not;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now the elder kept his birthday feast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Summoning his friends around him, first the King.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doubtful and sad, the o'er-gentle monarch mused:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'To feast with sinners is to sanction sin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A deed abhorred; the alternative is hard:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must then their sovereign shame with open scorn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kinsman and friend? I think they mourn the past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, were our Bishop here, would pardon sue.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Boding, yet self-deceived, he joined that feast:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thereat he saw scant sign of penitence:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere long he bade farewell.<br /></span>
<span class="i26">That self-same hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cedd from his northern pilgrimage returned;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The monarch met him at the offenders' gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, instant when he saw that reverend face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sin before him stood. Down from his horse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaping, he told him all, and penance prayed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long time the old man on that royal front<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fixed a sad eye. 'Thy sin was great, my son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shaming thy God to spare a sinner's shame:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sin thy God forgives, and I remit:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But those whom God forgives He chastens oft:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My son, I see a sign upon thy brow!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere yonder lessening moon completes her wane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold, the blood-stained hand late clasped in thine<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span><span class="i0">Shall drag thee to thy death.' The King replied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'A Sigebert there lived, East Anglia's King,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose death was glorious to his realm. May mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dark and inglorious, strengthen hearts infirm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And profit thus my land.'<br /></span>
<span class="i26">A time it was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Christian mercy, judged by Pagan hearts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not virtue seemed but sin. That sin's reproach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The King had long sustained. Ere long it chanced<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, near the stronghold of that impious feast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A vanquished rebel, long in forests hid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew near, and knelt to Sigebert for grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And won his suit. The monarch's kinsmen twain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those men of blood, forth-gazing from a tower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw all; heard all. Upon them fury fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when through cloudless skies there comes a blast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From site unknown, that, instant, finds its prey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Circling some white-sailed bark, or towering tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, with a touch, down-wrenching; all things else<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unharmed, though near. They snatched their daggers up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rushed upon their prey, and, shouting thus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'White-livered slave, that mak'st thy throne a jest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mock'st great Odin's self, and us, thy kin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To please thy shaveling,' struck him through the heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, spurring through the woodlands to the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were never heard of more.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span><span class="i24">Throughout the land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lament was made; lament in every house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As though in each its eldest-born lay dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lament far off and near. The others wept:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cedd, in long vigils of the lonely night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not wept alone, but lifted strength of prayer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, morn by morn, that Sacrifice Eterne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mightier tenfold in impetrative power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than prayers of all man's race, from Adam's first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To his who latest on the Judgment Day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall raise his hands to God. Four years went by:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That mourner's wound they staunched not. Oft in sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He murmured low, 'Would I had died for thee!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And once, half-waked by rush of morning rains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Why saw I on his brow that fatal sign?&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He might have lived till now!' Within his heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last there rose a cry, 'To Lastingham!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pray with thy brothers three, for saints are they:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So shall thy friend, who resteth in the Lord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With perfect will submiss, the waiting passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gaze on God's Vision with an eye unscaled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In glory everlasting.' At that thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peace on the old man settled. Staff in hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth on his way he fared. Nor horse he rode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor sandals wore. He walked with feet that bled,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span><span class="i0">Paying, well pleased, that penance for his King;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And murmured ofttimes, 'Not my blood alone!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, but my life, my life!'<br /></span>
<span class="i30">Yet penance pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like pain of suffering Souls at peace with God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quelled not that gladness which, from secret source<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rising, o'erflowed his heart. Old times returned:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more beside him rode his King in youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Southward to where his realm&mdash;his duty&mdash;lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exulting captive of the Saviour Lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With face love-lit. As then, the vernal prime<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hourly with ampler respiration drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Delight of purer green from balmier airs:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As then the sunshine glittered. By their path<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now hung the woodbine; now the hare-bell waved;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rivulets new-swoll'n by melted snows, and birds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Mid echoing boughs with rival rapture sang:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At times the monks forgat their Christian hymns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By humbler anthems charmed. They gladdened more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beholding oft in cottage doors cross-crowned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Angelic faces, or in lonely ways;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once as they passed there stood a little maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some ten years old, alone 'mid lonely pines,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With violets crowned and primrose. Who were those,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The forest's white-robed guests, she nothing knew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not less she knelt. With hand uplifted Cedd<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span><span class="i0">Signed her his blessing. Hand she kissed in turn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then waved, yet ceased not from her song, 'Alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Two lovers sat at sunset.'<br /></span>
<span class="i28">Every eve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some village gave the wanderers food and rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or half-built convent with its church thick-walled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And polished shafts, great names in after times,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ely, and Croyland, Southwell, Medeshamstede,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adding to sylvan sweetness holier grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or rising lonely o'er morass and mere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With bowery thickets isled, where dogwood brake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Retained, though late, its red. To Boston near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Ouse, and Aire, and Derwent join with Trent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And salt sea waters mingle with the fresh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They met a band of youths that o'er the sands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Advanced with psalm, cross-led. The monks rejoiced,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save one from Ireland&mdash;Dicul. He, quick-eared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had caught that morn a war-cry on the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, sideway glancing from his Office-book,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Descried the cause. From Mercia's realm a host<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had crossed Northumbria's bound. His thin, worn face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er-flamed with sudden anger, thus he cried:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'In this, your land, men say, "Who worketh prays;"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In mine we say, "Well prays who fighteth well:"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Pagan race treads down your homesteads! Slaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That close not with their throats!'<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span><span class="i34">Advancing thus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the tenth eve they came to Lastingham:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth rushed the brethren, watching long far off,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To meet them, first the brothers three of Cedd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who kissed him, cheek and mouth. Gladly that night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those foot-worn travellers laid them down, and slept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save one alone. Old Cedd his vigil made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, kneeling by the tabernacle's lamp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prayed for the man he mourned for, ending thus:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Thou Lord of Souls, to Thee the Souls are dear!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou yearn'st toward them as they yearn to Thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold, not prayer alone for him I raise:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I offer Thee my life.' When morning's light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that great church commingled with its gloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The monks, slow-pacing, by that kneeler knelt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And prayed for Sigebert, beloved of God;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lastly offered Mass: and it befell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That when, the Offering offered, and the Dead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rightly remembered, he who sang that Mass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had reached the 'Nobis quoque famulis,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There came to Cedd an answer from the Lord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard in his heart; and he beheld his King<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Throned 'mid the Saints Elect of God who keep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perpetual triumph, and behold that Face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which to its likeness hourly more compels<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those faces t'ward It turned. That function o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span><span class="i0">Thus spake the Bishop: 'Brethren, sing "Te Deum;"'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They sang it; while within him he replied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Lord, let Thy servant now depart in peace.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A week went by with gladness winged and prayer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In wonder Cedd beheld those structures new<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From small beginnings reared, though many a gift,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sent for that work's behoof, had fed the poor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In famine time laid low. Moorlands he saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By cornfields vanquished; marked the all-beauteous siege<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of pasture yearly threatening loftier crags<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loud with the bleat of lambs. Their shepherd once<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had roved a bandit; next had toiled a slave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now with both hands he poured his weekly wage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down on his young wife's lap, his pretty babes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gambolling around for joy. A hospital<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood by the convent's gate. With moistened eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Musing on Him Who suffers in His sick,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Bishop paced it. There he found his death:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That year a plague had wasted all the land:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It reached him. Late that night he said, ''Tis well!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In three days more he lay with hands death cold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crossed on a peaceful breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i32">Like winter cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Borne through dark air, that portent feared of man,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span><span class="i0">Ill tidings, making way with mystic speed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shadowed ere long the troubled bank of Thames,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spread a wailing round its Minsters twain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saint Peter's and Saint Paul's. Saint Alban's caught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That cry, and northward echoed. Southward soon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forlorn it rang 'mid towers of Rochester;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then seaward died. But in that convent pile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherein so long the Saint had made abode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A different grief there lived, a deeper grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That grief which part hath none in sobs or tears&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which needs must act. There thirty monks arose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, taking each his staff, made vow thenceforth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To serve God's altar where their father died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or share his grave. Through Ithancestor's gate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As forth they paced between two kneeling crowds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little homeless boy, who heard their dirge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Late orphaned, at its grief he marvelled not),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So loved them that he followed, shorter steps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doubling 'gainst theirs. At first the orphan went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That mood relaxed: before them now he ran<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pluck a flower; as oft he lagged behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wild bird's song so aptly imitating<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, by his music drawn, or by his looks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That bird at times forgat her fears, and perched<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pleased on his arm. As flower and bird to him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such to those monks the child. Better each day<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span><span class="i0">He loved them; yet, revering, still he mocked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And though he mocked, he kissed. The westering sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the eighth eve from towers of Lastingham<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Welcomed those strangers. In another hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well-nigh arrived, they saw that grave they sought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sole on the church's northern slope. As when,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some father, absent long, returns at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His children rush loud-voiced from field to house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cling about his knees; and they that mark&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old reaper, bent no more, with hook in hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or ploughman, leaning 'gainst the old blind horse&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beholding wonder not; so to that grave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rushed they; so clung. Around that grave ere long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their own were ranged. That plague which smote the sire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spared not his sons. With ministering hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From pallet still to pallet passed the boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now from the dark spring wafting colder draught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now moistening fevered lips, or on the brow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spreading the new-bathed cincture. Him alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The infection reached not. When the last was gone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He felt as though the earth, man's race&mdash;yea, God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself&mdash;were dead. Around he gazed, and spake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Why then do I remain?'<br /></span>
<span class="i28">From hill to hill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(The monks on reverend offices intent)<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span><span class="i0">All solitary oft that boy repaired,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From each in turn forth gazing, fain to learn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If friend were t'wards him nighing. Many a hearth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More late, bereavement's earlier anguish healed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Welcomed the creature: many a mother held<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The milk-bowl to his mouth, in both hands stayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With smile the deeper for the draught prolonged,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lodged, as he departed, in his hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her latest crust. With children of his age<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seldom he played. That convent gave him rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor lost he aught, surviving thus his friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since childhood's sacred innocence he kept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While life remained, unspotted. When mature<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Five years he lived there monk, and reverence drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To that high convent through his saintly ways;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then died. Within that cirque of thirty graves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They laid him, close to Cedd. In later years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because they ne'er could learn his name or race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet forget his gentle looks, the name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Deodatus graved they on his tomb.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">'The Mother of the Churches,' thus he spake,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The British bishops hurled defiance stern<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against his head, while Cambrian peaks far off<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Slowly and sadly as the sun declined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last, though late, that Roman rose and stretched<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lean hand t'ward that circle, speaking thus:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Hear then the sentence of your God on sin!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because ye willed not peace, behold the sword!<br /></span>

<span class="i30">Edwin slain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far off in exile dwelt his nephews long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oswald and Oswy. Alba gave them rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alba, not yet called Scotland. Ireland's sons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Scoti named, had warred on Alba's Picts:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Columba's Gospel vanquished either race;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Won both to God. It won not less those youths,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In boyhood Oswald, Oswy still a child.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That child was wild and hot, and had his moods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Despotic now, now mirthful. Mild as Spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was Oswald's soul, majestic and benign;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thoughtful his azure eyes, serene his front;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He of his ravished sceptre little recked;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shepherds were his friends; the mountain deer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would pluck the ivy fearless from his hand:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In gladness walked he till Northumbria's cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smote on his heart. 'Why rest I here in peace,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus mused he, 'while my brethren groan afar?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By night he fled with twelve companion youths,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Christians like him, and reached his native land.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too fallen it seemed to aid him. On he passed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ways were desolate, yet evermore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A slender band around his footsteps drew,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span><span class="i0">Less seeking victory than an honest death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft gazed their King upon them; murmured oft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Few hands&mdash;true hearts!' Sudden aloud he cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Plant here the royal Standard, friends, and hence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let sound the royal trumpet.'<br /></span>
<span class="i28">Stern response<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reached him ere long: not Mercia's realm alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cambria that heard the challenge joined the war:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cambria, upon whose heart the ancestral woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ever with the years, like letters graved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On growing pines, grew larger and more large;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Penda forth she stretched a hand blood-red;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Christian with Pagan joined, an unblest bond,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A league accursed. The indomitable hate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Compelled that league. Still from his cave the Seer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Admonished, 'Set the foe against the foe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slay last the conqueror!' and from rock and hill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Bard cried, 'Vengeance!' In the bardic clan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That hatred of their country's ancient bane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lived like a faith. One night it chanced a tarn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secreted high 'mid cold and moonless hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bursting its bank down burst. That valley's Bard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clomb to the church-roof from his buried house:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thence rang his song,&mdash;'twas 'Vengeance!&mdash;Vengeance' still!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That torrent reached the roof: he clomb the tower:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span><span class="i0">The torrent mounted: on the bleak hill-side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All night the dalesmen, wailing o'er their drowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the roar of winds and downward rocks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still heard that war-song, 'Vengeance! Blood for blood!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last the tower fell flat, and winter morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone on the waters only.<br /></span>
<span class="i28">Three short weeks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dinned with alarums passed; in Mercia still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay Penda, sickness-struck, when, face to face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Cambrian host and Oswald's little band<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exulting met at sunset near a height<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then 'Heaven-Field' named, but later 'Oswald's Field,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Backed by that Wall the Roman built of old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His fence from sea to sea. There Oswald stood:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There raised with hands outstretched a mighty Cross,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strong-based, and deep in earth: his comrades twelve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around it heaped the soil, while priests white-stoled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chanted 'Vexilla Regis.' Work and rite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Complete, the King knelt down and made his prayer:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'True God Eternal, look upon this Cross,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sole now standing on Northumbria's breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And help Thine own, though few, who trust in Thee!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That night before his tent the wanderer sate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Listening the circling sentinel, or bay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wakeful hound remote, or downward course<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span><span class="i0">Of streams from moorland hills. Before his view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His whole life rose: his father's angry brow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The eyes all-wondrous, and all-tender hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her, his mother, striving evermore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To keep betwixt her husband and her sire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unbroken bond: his exiled days returned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The kind that pitied them, the rude that jeered;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lastly, that monk whose boast was evermore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Columba of Iona, Columkille;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That monk who made him Christian. 'Come what may,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus Oswald mused, 'I have not lived in vain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lose I or win, a kingdom there remains;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though not on earth!' A tear the vision dimmed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As thus he closed, 'My mother will be there!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then sank his lids in slumber.<br /></span>
<span class="i30">On his sleep&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was this indeed but dream?&mdash;a glory brake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Columba, dear to Oswald from his youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Columba, clad in glory as the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside him stood, and spake: 'Be strong! On earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There lives not who can guess the might of prayer:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What then is prayer on high?' The saintly Shape<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heavenward his hands upraised, while rose to heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His stature, towering ever high and higher,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warlike and priestly both. As morning cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blown by a mighty wind his robe ran forth,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span><span class="i0">Then stood, a golden wall that severance made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twixt Oswald's band and that unnumbered host.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again he spake, 'Put on thee heart of man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fight: though few, thy warriors shall not die<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In darkness of an unbelieving land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But live, and live to God.' The vision passed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Oswald's seat his warriors stood and cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'The Bull-horn! Hark!' The monarch told them all:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They answered, 'Let thy God sustain thy throne:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thenceforth our God is He.'<br /></span>
<span class="i32">The sun uprose:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere long the battle joined. Three dreadful hours<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doubtful the issue hung. Fierce Cambria's sons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With chief and clan, with harper and with harp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though terrible yet mirthful in their mood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rushed to their sport. Who mocked their hope that day?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did Angels help the just? Their falling blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say, leaped it up once more, each drop a man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their phalanx to replenish? Backward driven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again that multitudinous foe returned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With clangour dire; futile, again fell back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down dashed, like hailstone showers from palace halls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where princes feast secure. Astonishment<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smote them at last. Through all those serried ranks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Compact so late, sudden confusions ran<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like lines divergent through a film of ice<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span><span class="i0">Stamped on by arm√®d heel, or rifts on plains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prescient of earthquake underground. Their chiefs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sounded the charge;&mdash;in vain: Distrust, Dismay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ill Gods, the darkness lorded of that hour:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Panic to madness turned. Cadwallon sole<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From squadron on to squadron speeding still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As on a wing√®d steed&mdash;his snow-white hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind him blown&mdash;a mace in either hand&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stayed while he might the inevitable rout;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then sought his death, and found. Some fated Power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mightier than man's that hour dragged back his hosts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against their will and his; as when the moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrouded herself, drags back the great sea-tides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That needs must follow her receding wheels<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though wind and wave gainsay them, breakers wan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thundering indignant down nocturnal shores,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And city-brimming floods against their will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down drawn to river-mouths.<br /></span>
<span class="i30">In after days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who scaped made oath that in the midmost fight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The green earth sickened with a brazen glare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While darkness held the skies. They saw besides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Heaven-Field height a Cross, and, at its foot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sworded warrior vested like a priest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who still in stature high and higher towered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As raged the battle. Higher far that Cross<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span><span class="i0">Above him rose, barring with black the stars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That bickered through the eclipse's noonday night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ever from its bleeding arms sent forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thick-volleyed lightnings, azure fork and flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through all that headlong host.<br /></span>
<span class="i30">At eventide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where thickest fight had mingled, Oswald stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With raiment red as his who treads alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wine-vat when the grapes are all pressed out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet scathless and untouched. His mother's smile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was radiant on his pure and youthful face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Joyous, but not exulting. At his foot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cadwallon lay, with four-score winters white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A threatening corse: not death itself could shake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mace from either rigid hand close-clenched,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or smooth his brow. Above him Oswald bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then spake: 'He also loved his native land:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bear him with honour hence to hills of Wales,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lay him with his Fathers.'<br /></span>
<span class="i32">Thus was raised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In righteousness King Oswald's throne. But he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mindful in victory of Columba's word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus mused, 'The Master is as he that serves:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How shall I serve this people?' O'er the waves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then sent he of his Twelve the eldest three:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They to Iona sailed, and standing there<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span><span class="i0">In full assembly of Iona's saints<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Addressed them: 'To Columba Oswald thus:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him that propped the King on Heaven-Field's height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That held the battle-balance high that day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unite my realm to Christ!' The monks replied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Such mission should be Aidan's.' Aidan went.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With gladness Oswald met him, and with gifts:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Aidan said, 'Entreat me not to dwell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There where Paulinus dwelt, the man of God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In thy chief city, York. Thy race is fierce;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And meekness only can subdue the proud:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy people first I want;&mdash;through them the great.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grant me some island 'mid the raging main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Humble and low, not cheered by smiling meads,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where with my brethren I may watch with God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Henceforth my only aid.' Oswald replied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Let Lindisfarne be thine. That rock-based keep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Built by my grandsire Ida o'er it peers:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall be near thee though I see thee not.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then Aidan on the Isle of Lindisfarne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upreared that monastery which ruled in Christ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So long the Northern realm. A plain rock-girt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Level it lies and low: nor flower nor fruit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gladdens its margin: thin its sod, and bleak:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twice, day by day, the salt sea hems it round:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span><span class="i0">And twice a day the melancholy sands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er-wailed by sea-bird, and with sea-weed strewn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Replace the lonely ocean. Sacred Isles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That westward, eastward, guard the imperial realm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Iona! Lindisfarne! With you compared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How poor that lilied Delos of old Greece,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all its laurel bowers and nightingales!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">England's great hands were ye to God forth stretched<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through adverse climes, beneath the Boreal star,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That took His Stigmata. In sanctity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were her foundations laid. Her later crowns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Freedom first, of Science, and of Song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She owes them all to you!<br /></span>
<span class="i30">In Lindisfarne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aidan, and his, rejoicing dwelt with God:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the winter storm their anthems rose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from their sanctuary lamp the gleam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far shone from wave to wave. On starless nights<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Bamborough's turret Oswald watched it long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before his casement kneeling&mdash;first alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Companioned later. Kineburga there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside him knelt ere long, his tender bride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young, beauteous, modest, noble. 'Not for them,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus spake the newly wedded, 'not for them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For man's sake severed from the world of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In ceaseless vigil warring upon sin,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span><span class="i0">Ah, not for them the flower of life, the harp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High feast, or bridal torch!' Purer perchance<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Their</i> bridal torch burned on because from far<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sacred lamp had met its earliest beam!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There Aidan lived, and wafted, issuing thence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er wilds Bernician and fierce battle-fields<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The strength majestic of his still retreat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The puissance of a soul whose home was God.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'What man is this,' the warriors asked, 'that moves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unarmed among us; lifts his crucifix,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And says, "Ye swords, lie prone"?' The revelling crew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose from their cups: 'He preaches abstinence:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold, the man is mortified himself:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moonlight of his watchings and his fasts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He carries on his face.' When Princes forced<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Largess upon him, he replied, 'I want<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not yours but you;' and with their gifts redeemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The orphan slave. The poor were as his children:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He to the beggar stinted not his hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor, giving, said 'Be brief.' Such seed bare fruit:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God in the dark, primeval woods had reared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A race whose fierceness had its touch of ruth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brave, cordial, chaste, and simple. Reverence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That race preserved: Reverence advanced to Love:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ties of life it honoured: lit from heaven<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span><span class="i0">They wore a meaning new. The Faith of Christ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Banished the bestial from the heart of man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Restored the Hope divine.<br /></span>
<span class="i25">In all his toils<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oswald with Aidan walked. Impartial law,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not licence, not despotic favour, stands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Truth auxiliar true. Such laws were his:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet not through such alone he worked for Truth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Function he claimed more high. When Aidan preached;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In forest depths when thousands girt him round;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When countless eyes, a clinging weight, were bent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon his lips&mdash;all knew they spake from God,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The King, with monks from Ireland knit of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the Bishop stood; each word he spake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Changed to the Saxon tongue.<br /></span>
<span class="i32">Earth were not earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If reign like Oswald's lasted. Penda lived;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor e'er from Oswald turned for eight long years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An eye like some swart planet feared of man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Omen of wars or plague. Cadwallon's fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ally ill-starred, that fought without his aid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er-flushed old hatred with a fiery shame:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cadwallon nightly frowned above his dreams.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tyrant watched his time. At Maserfield<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The armies met. There on Northumbria's day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Settled what seemed, yet was not, endless night<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span><span class="i0">There Faith and Virtue, deathless, seemed to die:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There holy Oswald fell. For God he fought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fought for his country. Walled with lances round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sheaf of arrows quivering in his breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One moment yet he stood. 'Preserve,' he cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'My country, God!' then added, gazing round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'And these my soldiers: make their spirits thine!'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus perished good King Oswald, King and Saint;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saint by acclaim of nations canonised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere yet the Church had spoken. Year by year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Hexham monks to Heaven-Field, where of old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had stood that 'Cross which conquered,' made repair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With chanted psalm; and pilgrims daily prayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where died the just and true. Not vain their vows:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In righteousness foundations had been laid:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The earthquake reached them not. The Dane passed by<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High up the Norman glittered: but beneath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Faith profounder based, and gentler Law<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Saxon realm lived on.<br /></span>
<span class="i28">But never more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Heaven-Field's wreck the Briton raised his head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Britain thenceforth was England. His the right;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The land was his of old; and in God's House<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His of the island races stood first-born:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not less he sinned through hate, esteeming more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Memories of wrong than forward-looking hopes<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span><span class="i0">And triumphs of the Truth. For that cause God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His face in blessing to the younger turned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More honouring Pagans who in ignorance erred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than those who, taught of God, concealed their gift,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Divorcing Faith from Love. Natheless they clung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That remnant spared, to rocky hills of Wales<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With eagle clutch, whoe'er in England ruled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Horsa's day to Edward's. Centuries eight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In gorge or vale sea-lulled they held their own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By native monarchs swayed, while native harps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rang out from native cliffs defiant song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wild as their singing pines. Heroic Land!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Freedom was thine; the torrent's plunge; the peak;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pale mist past it borne! Heroic Race!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caractacus was thine, and Galgacus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Boadicea, greater by her wrongs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than by her lineage. Battle-axe of thine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rang loud and long on Roman helms ere yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hengist had trod the island. Thine that King<br /></span>
<span class="i0">World-famed, who led to fifty war-fields forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Gainst Saxon hosts his sinewy, long-haired race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unmailed, yet victory-crowned; that King who left<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tintagel, Camelot, and Lyonnesse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Immortal names, though wild as elfin notes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From phantom rocks echoed in fairy land&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great Arthur! Year by year his deeds were sung,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span><span class="i0">While he in Glastonbury's cloister slept,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">By Europe's minstrels then, from age to age;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ne'er by ampler voice, or richlier toned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than England lists to-day. Race once of Saints!<br /></span>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Ceadmon, a cowherd, being at a feast, declares when the harp
reaches him, that he cannot sing. As he sleeps, a divine Voice
commands him to sing. He obeys, and the gift of song is imparted to
him. Hilda, Abbess of Whitby, enrolls him among her monks; and in
later years he sings the revolt of the Fallen Angels, and many
Christian mysteries, thus becoming the first English poet. </p></div>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Alone upon the pleasant bank of Esk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ceadmon the Cowherd stood. The sinking sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reddened the bay, and fired the river-bank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flamed upon the ruddy herds that strayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the marge, clear-imaged. None was nigh:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that cause spake the Cowherd, 'Praise to God!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He made the worlds; and now, by Hilda's hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Planteth a crown on Whitby's holy crest:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Daily her convent towers more high aspire:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Daily ascend her Vespers. Hark that strain!<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span><span class="i0">He stood and listened. Soon the flame-touched herds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sent forth their lowings, and the cliffs replied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Ceadmon thus resumed: 'The music note<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rings through their lowings dull, though heard by few!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor kine, ye do your best! Ye know not God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet man, his likeness, unto you is God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And him ye worship with obedience sage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A grateful, sober, much-enduring race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That o'er the vernal clover sigh for joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With winter snows contend not. Patient kine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What thought is yours, deep-musing? Haply this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"God's help! how narrow are our thoughts, and few!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not so the thoughts of that slight human child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who daily drives us with her blossomed rod<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From lowland valleys to the pails long-ranged!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take comfort, kine! God also made your race!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If praise from man surceased, from your broad chests<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That God would perfect praise, and, when ye died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resound it from yon rocks that gird the bay:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God knoweth all things. Let that thought suffice!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Thus spake the ruler of the deep-mouthed kine:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They were not his; the man and they alike<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A neighbour's wealth. He was contented thus:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span><span class="i0">Humble he was in station, meek of soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unlettered, yet heart-wise. His face was pale;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stately his frame, though slightly bent by age:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slow were his eyes, and slow his speech, and slow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His musing step; and slow his hand to wrath;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A massive hand, but soft, that many a time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had succoured man and woman, child and beast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet could fiercely grasp the sword. At times<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As mightily it clutched his ashen goad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When like an eagle on him swooped some thought:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then stood he as in dream, his pallid front<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brightening like eastern sea-cliffs when a moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unrisen is near its rising.<br /></span>
<span class="i26">Round the bay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime, as twilight deepened, many a fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up-sprang, and horns were heard. Around the steep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With bannered pomp and many a tossing plume<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Advancing slow a cavalcade made way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oswy, Northumbria's king, the foremost rode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oswy triumphant o'er the Mercian host,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invoking favour on his sceptre new;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With him an Anglian prince, student long time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Bangor of the Irish, and a monk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Frankish race far wandering from the Marne:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They came to look on Hilda, hear her words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of far-famed wisdom on the Interior Life;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span><span class="i0">For Hilda thus discoursed: 'True life of man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is life within: inward immeasurably<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The being winds of all who walk the earth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he whom sense hath blinded nothing knows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that wide greatness: like a boy is he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A boy that clambers round some castle's wall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In search of nests, the outward wall of seven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet nothing knows of those great courts within,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hall where princes banquet, or the bower<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where royal maids discourse with lyre and lute,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Much less its central church, and sacred shrine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherein God dwells alone.' Thus Hilda spake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they that gazed upon her widening eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Low whispered, each to each, 'She speaks of things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which she hath seen and known.'<br /></span>
<span class="i34">On Whitby's height<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The royal feast was holden: far below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A noisier revel dinned the shore; therein<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The humbler guests made banquet. Many a tent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gleamed on the yellow sands by ripples kissed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a savoury dish sent up its steam;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The farmer from the field had brought his calf;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fishers that increase scaled which green-gulfed seas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From womb crystalline, teeming, yield to man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Jock, the woodsman, from his oaken glades<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tall stag, arrow-pierced. In gay attire<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span><span class="i0">Now green, now crimson, matron sat and maid:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each had her due: the elder, reverence most,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lovelier that and love. Beside the board<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beggar lacked not place.<br /></span>
<span class="i32">When hunger's rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sharpened by fresh sea-air, was quelled, the jest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Succeeded, and the tale of foreign lands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, boast who might of distant chief renowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His battle-axe, or fist that felled an ox,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Anglian's answer was 'our Hilda' still:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Is not her prayer trenchant as sworded hosts?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her insight more than wisdom of the seers?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What birth like hers illustrious? Edwin's self,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">D√´ira's exile, next Northumbria's king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her kinsman was. Together bowed they not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he of holy hand, missioned from Rome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Paulinus, o'er them poured the absolving wave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And joined to Christ? Kingliest was she, that maid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who spurned earth-crowns!' More late the miller rose&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He ruled the feast, the miller old, yet blithe&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cried, 'A song!' So song succeeded song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For each man knew that time to chant his stave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But no man yet sang nobly. Last the harp<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made way to Ceadmon, lowest at the board:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He pushed it back, answering, 'I cannot sing:'<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span><span class="i0">The rest around him flocked with clamour, 'Sing!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one among them, voluble and small,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shot out a splenetic speech: 'This lord of kine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our herdsman, grows to ox! Behold, his eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Move slow, like eyes of oxen!'<br /></span>
<span class="i31">Slowly rose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ceadmon, and spake: 'I note full oft young men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quick-eyed, but small-eyed, darting glances round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now here, now there, like glance of some poor bird,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That light on all things and can rest on none:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As ready are they with their tongues as eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all their songs are chirpings backward blown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On winds that sing God's song, by them unheard:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My oxen wait my service: I depart.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then strode he to his cow-house in the mead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Displeased though meek, and muttered, 'Slow of eye!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My kine are slow: if rapid I, my hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might tend them worse.' Hearing his step, the kine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turned round their horn√®d fronts; and angry thoughts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went from him as a vapour. Straw he brought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strewed their beds; and they, contented well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid down ere long their great bulks, breathing deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the glimmering moonlight. He, with head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Propped on a favourite heifer's snowy flank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rested, his deer-skin o'er him drawn. Hard days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring slumber soon. His latest thought was this:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span><span class="i0">'Though witless things we are, my kine and I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet God it was who made us.'<br /></span>
<span class="i29">As he slept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside him stood a Man Divine, and spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Ceadmon, arise, and sing,' Ceadmon replied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'My Lord, I cannot sing, and for that cause<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth from the revel came I. Once, in youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I willed to sing the bright face of a maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And failed, and once a gold-faced harvest-field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And failed, and once the flame-eyed face of war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And failed again.' To him the Man Divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Those themes were earthly. Sing!' And Ceadmon said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'What shall I sing, my Lord?' Then answer came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Ceadmon, stand up, and sing thy song of God.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">At once obedient, Ceadmon rose, and sang;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And help was with him from great thoughts of old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yearly within his silent nature stored,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That swelled, collecting like a flood which bursts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In spring its icy bar. The Lord of all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sang; that God beneath whose hand eterne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then when He willed forth-stretched athwart the abyss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Creation like a fiery chariot ran,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth-borne on wheels of ever-living stars:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span><span class="i0">Him first he sang. The builder, here below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From fair foundations rears at last the roof;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Song, a child of heaven, begins with heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The archetype divine, and end of all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More late descends to earth. He sang that hymn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Let there be light, and there was light;' and lo!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the void deep came down the seal of God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stamped immortal form. Clear laughed the skies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From circumambient deeps the strong earth brake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both continent and isle; while downward rolled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sea-surge summoned to his home remote.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then came a second vision to the man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There standing 'mid his oxen. Darkness sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sang, of pleasant frondage clothed the vales,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And purple glooms ambrosial cast from hills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now by the sun deserted, which the moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A glory new-created in her place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silvered with virgin beam, while sang the bird<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her first of love-songs on the branch first-flower'd&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not yet the lion stalked. And Ceadmon sang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er-awed, the Father of all humankind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Standing in garden planted by God's hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And girt by murmurs of the rivers four,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between the trees of Knowledge and of Life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With eastward face. In worship mute of God,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span><span class="i0">Eden's Contemplative he stood that hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not her Ascetic, since, where sin is none,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No need for spirit severe.<br /></span>
<span class="i28">And Ceadmon sang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God's Daughter, Adam's Sister, Child, and Bride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our Mother Eve. Lit by the matin star,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That nearer drew to earth and brighter flashed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To meet her gaze, that snowy Innocence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood up with queenly port: she turned; she saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth's King, mankind's great Father: taught by God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Immaculate, unastonished, undismayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In love and reverence to her Lord she drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, kneeling, kissed his hand: and Adam laid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That hand, made holier, on that kneeler's head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spake; 'For this shall man his parents leave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to his wife cleave fast.'<br /></span>
<span class="i30">When Ceadmon ceased,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus spake the Man Divine: 'At break of day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seek out some prudent man, and say that God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath loosed thy tongue; nor hide henceforth thy gift.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Ceadmon turned, and slept among his kine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dreamless. Ere dawn he stood upon the shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In doubt: but when at last o'er eastern seas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun, long wished for, like a god upsprang,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more he found God's song upon his mouth<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span><span class="i0">Murmuring high joy; and sought an ancient friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And told him all the vision. At the word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He to the Abbess with the tidings sped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she made answer, 'Bring me Ceadmon here.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Then clomb the pair that sea-beat mount of God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fanned by sea-gale, nor trod, as others used,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The curving way, but faced the abrupt ascent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And halted not, so worked in both her will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till now between the unfinished towers they stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Panting and spent. The portals open stood:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ceadmon passed in alone. Nor ivory decked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor gold, the walls. That convent was a keep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strong 'gainst invading storm or demon hosts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And naked as the rock whereon it stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, as a church, august. Dark, high-arched roofs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slowly let go the distant hymn. Each cell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cinctured its statued saint, the peace of God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On every stony face. Like caverned grot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far off the western window frowned: beyond,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close by, there shook an autumn-blazoned tree:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No need for gems beside of storied glass.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">He entered last that hall where Hilda sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Begirt with a great company, the chiefs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far ranged from end to end. Three stalls, cross-crowned,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span><span class="i0">Stood side by side, the midmost hers. The years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had laid upon her brows a hand serene;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There left alone a blessing. Levelled eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sable, and keen, with meditative might<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conjoined the instinct and the claim to rule:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Firm were her lips and rigid. At her right<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sat Finan, Aidan's successor, with head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Snow-white, and beard that rolled adown a breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never by mortal passion heaved in storm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A cloister of majestic thoughts that walked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Humbly with God. High in the left-hand stall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oswy was throned, a man in prime, with brow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Less youthful than his years. Exile long past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or deepening thought of one disastrous deed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had left a shadow in his eyes. The strength<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of passion held in check looked lordly forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From head and hand: tawny his beard; his hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thick-curled and dense. Alert the monarch sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half turned, like one on horseback set that hears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he alone, the advancing trump of war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down the long gallery strangers thronged in mass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dane or Norwegian, huge of arm through weight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of billows oar-subdued, with stormy looks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wild as their waves and crags; Southerns keen-browed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pure Saxon youths, fair-fronted, with mild eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These less than others strove for nobler place,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span><span class="i0">And Pilgrim travel-worn. Behind the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And higher-ranged in marble-arched arcade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sat Hilda's sisterhood. Clustering they shone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White-veiled, and pale of face, and still and meek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An inly-bending curve, like some young moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose crescent glitters o'er a dusky strait.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In front were monks dark-stoled: for Hilda ruled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though feminine, two houses, one of men:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon two chasm-divided rocks they stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To various service vowed, though single Faith:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not ever, save at rarest festival,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their holy inmates met.<br /></span>
<span class="i26">'Is this the man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Favoured, though late, with gift of song?' thus spake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hilda with gracious smile. Severer then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She added: 'Son, the commonest gifts of God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He counts His best, and oft temptation blends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With ampler boon. Yet sing! That God who lifts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The violet from the grass could draw not less<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Song from the stone hard by. That strain thou sang'st,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more rehearse it.'<br /></span>
<span class="i26">Ceadmon from his knees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arose and stood. With princely instinct first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The strong man to the Abbess bowed, and next<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To that great twain, the bishop and the king,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span><span class="i0">Last to that stately concourse each side ranged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down the long hall; then, dubious, answered thus:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Great Mother, if that God who sent the song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vouchsafe me to recall it, I will sing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I misdoubt it lost.' Slowly his face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down-drooped, and all his body forward bent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While brooding memory, step by step, retraced<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its backward way. Vainly long time it sought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The starting-point. Then Ceadmon's large, soft hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Opening and closing worked; for wont were they,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In musings when he stood, to clasp his goad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And plant its point far from him, thereupon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Propping his stalwart weight. Customed support<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now finding not, unwittingly those hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reached forth, and on Saint Finan's crosier-staff<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Settling, withdrew it from the old bishop's grasp;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Ceadmon leant thereon, while passed a smile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From chief to chief to see earth's meekest man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spiritual sceptre claim of Lindisfarne.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They smiled; he triumphed: soon the Cowherd found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That first fair corner-stone of all his song;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thence rose the fabric heavenward. Lifting hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more his lordly music he rehearsed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The void abyss at God's command forth-flinging<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Creation like a Thought: where night had reigned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The universe of God.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Which with the Angels sang when earth was made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sang in his song. From highest shrill of lark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To ocean's moaning under cliffs low-browed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And roar of pine-woods on the storm-swept hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No tone was wanting; while to them that heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strange images looked forth of worlds new-born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair, phantom mountains, and, with forests plumed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaven-topping headlands, for the first time glassed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In waters ever calm. O'er sapphire seas<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Green islands laughed. Fairer, the wide earth's flower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eden, on airs unshaken yet by sighs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From bosom still inviolate forth poured<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Immortal sweets that sense to spirit turned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In part those noble listeners <i>made</i> that song!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their flashing eyes, their hands, their heaving breasts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tumult self-stilled, and mute, expectant trance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas these that gave their bard his twofold might&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That might denied to poets later born<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, singing to soft brains and hearts ice-hard,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A vainly-seeking eye, and, famished, drop<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hand clay-cold upon the unechoing shell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Missing their inspiration's human half.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span><span class="i0">The concourse stood, for all had risen, as though<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waiting from heaven its echo. Each on each<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gazed hard and caught his hands. Fiercely ere long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their gratulating shout aloft had leaped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Hilda laid her finger on her lip,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or provident lest praise might stain the pure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or deeming song a gift too high for praise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She spake: 'Through help of God thy song is sound:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now hear His Holy Word, and shape therefrom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A second hymn, and worthier than the first.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">She spake, and Finan standing bent his head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the sacred tome in reverence stayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon his kneeling deacon's hands and brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweetly sang five verses, thus beginning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'<i>Cum esset desponsata</i>,' and was still;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And next rehearsed them in the Anglian tongue:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Ceadmon took God's Word into his heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ruminating stood, as when the kine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their flowery pasture ended, ruminate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And was a man in thought. At last the light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone from his dubious countenance, and he spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Great Mother, lo! I saw a second Song!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">T'wards me it sailed; but with averted face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And borne on shifting winds. A man am I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sluggish and slow, that needs must muse and brood;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span><span class="i0">Therefore those verses till the sun goes down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will I revolve. If song from God be mine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Expect me here at morn.'<br /></span>
<span class="i28">The morrow morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that high presence Ceadmon stood and sang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A second song, and worthier than his first;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Hilda said, 'From God it came, not man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou therefore live a monk among my monks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sing to God.' Doubtful he stood&mdash;'From youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My place hath been with kine; their ways I know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how to cure their griefs,' Smiling she spake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Our convent hath its meads, and kine; with these<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Consort each morn: at noon to us return.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Ceadmon knelt, and bowed, and said, 'So be it:'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And aged Finan, and Northumbria's king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oswy, approved; and all that host had joy.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Thus in that convent Ceadmon lived, a monk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Humblest of all the monks, save him that knelt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In cell close by, who once had been a prince.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seven times a day he sang God's praises, first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When earliest dawn drew back night's sable veil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With trembling hand, revisiting the earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like some pale maid that through the curtain peers<br /></span>

<span class="i0">At last a brow of gold. In later years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By ancient yearnings driven, through wood and vale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He tracked D√´irean or Bernician glades<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To holy Ripon, or late-sceptred York,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not yet great Wilfred's seat, or Beverley:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The children gathered round him, crying, 'Sing!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They gave him inspiration with their eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with his conquering music he returned it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oftener he roamed that strenuous eastern coast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Jarrow and to Wearmouth, sacred sites<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The well-beloved of Bede, or northward more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Bamborough, Oswald's keep. At Coldingham<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sustained for centuries o'er the wild sea-surge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In region of dim mist and flying bird,<br /></span>

<span class="i30">Fair English shores,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Despite those blinding storms of north and east,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Like that blind Scian circling Grecian coasts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If God the song accorded, Ceadmon sang;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If God denied it, after musings deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He answered, 'I am of the kine and dumb;'&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The man revered his art, and fraudful song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Esteemed as fraudful coin.<br /></span>
<span class="i30">Music denied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He solaced them with tales wherein, so seemed it,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Lifted by hand unseen, witnessed that He,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Man's Maker, is the Healer too of man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And life His school parental. Parables<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He shewed in all things. 'Mark,' one day he cried,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Through spirits despondent, o'er the childless floor<br /></span>

<span class="i0">On Christian nights he sang that jubilant star<br /></span>

<span class="i0">By Joseph watched, and Mary. Pale, in Lent,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That in the black far-shadowing church whose bulk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up-towered between them and the moon, the monks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their matins had begun. A little sigh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That moment reached them from the central gloom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Guarding the sleeper's bed; a second sigh<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span><span class="i0">Succeeded: neither seemed the sigh of pain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some one said, 'He wakens.' Large and bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the church-roof sudden rushed the moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smote the cross above that sleeper's couch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smote that sleeper's face. The smile thereon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was calmer than the smile of life. Thus died<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ceadmon, the earliest bard of English song.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Young, beauteous, brave&mdash;the bravest of the brave&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who loved not Oswin? All that saw him loved:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aidan loved most, monk of Iona's Isle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Northumbria's bishop next, from Lindisfarne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ruling in things divine. One morn it chanced<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Oswin, noting how with staff in hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Aidan roamed his spiritual realm, footbare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wading deep stream, and piercing thorny brake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sent him a horse&mdash;his best. The Saint was pleased;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, onward while he rode, and, musing, smiled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To think of these his honours in old age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A beggar claimed his alms. 'Gold have I none,'<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span><span class="i0">Aidan replied; 'this horse be thine!' The King,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hearing the tale, was grieved. 'Keep I, my lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No meaner horses fit for beggar's use<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thus my best should seem a thing of naught?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Saint made answer: 'Beggar's use, my King!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What was that horse? The foal of some poor mare!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The least of men&mdash;the sinner&mdash;is God's child!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then dropped the King on both his knees, and cried:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Father, forgive me!' As they sat at meat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oswin was mirthful, and at jest and tale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hungry thanes laughed loud. But great, slow tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In silence trickled down old Aidan's face:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These all men marked; yet no man question made.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last to one beside him Aidan spake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Irish tongue, unknown to all save them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'God will not leave such meekness long on earth.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Who loved not Oswin? Not alone his realm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">D√´ira, loved him, but Bernician lords<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose monarch, Oswy, was a man of storms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fierce King albeit in youth baptized to Christ;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At heart half pagan. Swift as northern cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through summer skies, he swept with all his host<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down on the rival kingdom. Face to face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The armies stood. But Oswin, when he marked<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span><span class="i0">His own a little flock 'mid countless wolves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Addressed them thus: 'Why perish, friends, for me?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From exile came I: for my people's sake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To exile I return, or gladlier die:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Depart in peace.' He rode to Gilling Tower;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And waited there his fate. Thither next day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">King Oswy marched, and slew him.<br /></span>
<span class="i32">Twelve days passed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Aidan, while through green Northumbria's woods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pensive he paced, steadying his doubtful steps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Felt death approaching. Giving thanks to God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old man laid him by a church half raised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid great oaks and yews, and, leaning there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His head against the buttress, passed to God.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They made their bishop's grave at Lindisfarne;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Oswin rested at the mouth of Tyne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within a wave-girt, granite promontory<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where sea and river meet. For many an age<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pilgrim from far countries came in faith<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To that still shrine&mdash;they called it 'Oswin's Peace,'&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thither the outcast fled for sanctuary:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sick man there found health. Thus Oswin lived,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though dead, a benediction in the land.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What purest mouth, but roseless for great woe,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Pattered above the pavement of that church<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Canterbury by Augustine raised;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The child grew paler when Gregorian chants<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shook the dim roofs. Gladly the growing girl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hearkened to stories of her ancestress<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clotilda, boast of France, but weeping turned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From legends whispered by her Saxon nurse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Loke, the Spirit accursed that slanders gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Sinna, Queen of Hell. The years went by;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The last had brought King Oswy's embassage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With suit obsequious, 'Let the princess share<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With me her father's crown.' To simple hearts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Changes come gently. Soon, all trust, she stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before God's altar with her destined lord:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adown her finger while the bride-ring ran<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So slid into her heart a true wife's love:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rooted in faith, it ripened day by day&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now the end was this!<br /></span>
<span class="i28">There as she knelt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A strong foot clanged behind her. 'Weeping still!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up, wife of mine! If Oswin had not died<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His gracious ways had filched from me my realm,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span><span class="i0">The base so loved his meekness!' Turning not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She answered low: 'He died an unarmed man:'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Oswy: 'Fool that fought not when he might;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At least his slaughtered troop had decked his grave!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I scorned him for his grief that men should die;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, scorning him, I hated; yea, for that<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His blood is on my sword!'<br /></span>
<span class="i28">The priests of God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had faced the monarch and denounced his crime:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They might as well have preached to ocean waves:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He felt no anger: he but deemed them mad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smiling went his way. Thus autumn passed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The queen&mdash;he knew it&mdash;when alone wept on:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near him the pale face smiled; the voice was sweet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loving the service; the obedience full:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Neither by words, by silence, nor by looks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She chid him. Like some penitent she walked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That mourns her own great sin.<br /></span>
<span class="i32">Yet Oswy's heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remorseless thus, had moods of passionate love:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A warrior of his host, Tosti by name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay low, plague-stricken: kith and kin had fled:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whole days the king sustained upon his knees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sufferer's head, and cheered his heart with songs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Odin, strangely blent with Christian hymns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While ofttimes stormy bursts of tears descended<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span><span class="i0">Upon that face upturned. Ministering he sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till death the vigil closed.<br /></span>
<span class="i30">One winter night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From distant chase belated he returned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And passed by Oswin's grave. The snow, new-fallen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whitened the precinct. In the blast she knelt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While coldly glared the broad and bitter moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon those flying flakes that on her hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Settled, or on her thin, light raiment clung.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She heard him not draw nigh. She only beat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her breast, and, praying, wept: 'Our sin, our sin!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There as the monarch stood a change came o'er him:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old, exiled days in Alba as a dream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Redawned upon his spirit, and that look<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Aidan's eyes when, binding first that cross<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long by his pupil craved, around his neck,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He whispered: 'He who serveth Christ, his Lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must love his fellow-man.' As when a stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ice dissolved, grows audible once more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So came to him those words. They dragged him down:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knelt beside his wife, and beat his breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said, 'My sin, my sin!' Till earliest morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glimmered through sleet that twain wept on, prayed on:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was it the rising sun that lit at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fair face upward lifted;&mdash;kindled there<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span><span class="i0">A lovelier dawn than o'er it blushed when first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dropped on her bridegroom's breast? Aloud she cried:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Our prayer is heard: our penitence finds grace:'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then added: 'Let it deepen till we die!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A monastery build we on this grave:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So from this grave, while fleet the years, that prayer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall rise both day and night, till Christ returns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To judge the world&mdash;a prayer for him who died;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A prayer for one who sinned, but sins no more.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Where Gilling's long and lofty hill o'erlooks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For leagues the forest-girdled plain, ere long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A monastery stood. That self-same day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In tears the penitential work began;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Some muttering low of Odin. Near to these<br /></span>

<span class="i0">More fiery gesture. Splenetic, he marked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Christian albeit himself, those Christian walls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Saxon converts raised:&mdash;he was a Briton.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invisibly that morn a dusky crape<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yet blent it with that purple distance glimpsed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the forest alleys.<br /></span>
<span class="i28">In a tent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Finan sang Mass: his altar was that stone<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The king, the queen: alone their angels know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their thoughts that hour! The sacred rite complete,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They raised their brows, and, hand-in-hand, made way<br /></span>

<span class="i30">From that day forth<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In Penda's palace-keep the revel raged,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High feast of rites impure. At banquet sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The monarch and his chiefs; chant followed chant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bleeding with wars foregone. The day went by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, setting ere its time, a sanguine sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dipped into tumult vast of gathering storm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That soon incumbent leant from tower to tower<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shook them to their base. As high within<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gladness mounted, meeting storm with storm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till cried that sacrificial priest whose knife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had pierced the warrior victim's willing throat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That morn, 'Already with the gods we feast!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hark! round Valhalla swell the phantom wars!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere ceased the shout applausive, from his seat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uprose the warrior Saxo, in his hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The goblet, in the other Alp, his sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pointing to heaven. 'To Odin health!' he cried;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Would that this hour he rode into this hall!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He should not hence depart till blood of his<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had reddened Sleipner's flank, his snow-white steed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This sword would shed that blood!' Warriors sixteen<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span><span class="i0">Leaped up in wrath, and for a moment rage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rocked the huge hall. But Saxo waved his sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, laughing, shouted, 'Odin's sons, be still!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Count it no sin to battle with high gods!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great-hearted they! They give the blow and take!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Odin who was ever leal as I?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As sudden as it rose the tumult fell:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So ceased the storm without: but with it ceased<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rapture and the madness, and the shout:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wine-cup still made circuit; but the song<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Froze in mid-air. Strange shadow hung o'er all:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Neighbour to neighbour whispered: courtiers slid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through doors scarce open. Rumour had arrived,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If true or false none knew.<br /></span>
<span class="i28">The morrow morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Penda's court the bravest fled in fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Questioning with white lips, 'Will he slay his son?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or skulked at distance. Penda by the throat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Catching a white-cheeked courtier, cried: 'The truth!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What whisper they in corners?' On his knees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That courtier made confession. Penda then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Live, since my son is yet a living man!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Christian, say'st thou? Let him serve his Christ!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That man whom ever most I scorned is he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who vows him to the service of some god,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet breaks his laws; for that man walks, a lie.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span><span class="i0">My son shall live, and after me shall reign:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Northumbrian realm shall die!'<br /></span>
<span class="i32">Thus Penda spake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sent command from tower and town to blow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instant the trumpet of his last of wars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fanning from Odin's hall with airs ice-cold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of doom the foes of Odin. 'Man nor child,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sware,'henceforth shall tread Northumbrian soil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor hart nor hind: I spare the creeping worm:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My scavenger is he,' The Mercian realm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose at his call, innumerable mass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of warriors iron-armed. East Anglia sent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her hosts in aid. Apostate Ethelwald,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though Oswy's nephew, joined the hostile league,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thirty chiefs beside that ruled by right<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Princedom or province. Mightier far than these<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Cambria, brooding o'er the ancestral wrong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Saxon's sin original, met his call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And vowed her to the vengeance.<br /></span>
<span class="i34">Bravest hearts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hate most the needless slaughter. Oswy mused:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Long since too much of blood is on this hand:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall I for pride or passion risk once more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Northumbria, my mother;&mdash;rudely stain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her pretty babes with blood?' To Penda then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Camped on the confines of the adverse realms,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span><span class="i0">He sent an embassage of reverend men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warriors and priests. Before them, staff in hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peaceful, with hoary brows and measured tread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twelve heralds paced. Twelve caskets bare they heaped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With gems and gold, and thus addressed the King:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Lord of the Mercian realm, renowned in arms!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our lord, Northumbria's monarch, bids thee hail:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He never yet in little thing or great<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath wronged thy kingdom; yet thy peace he woos:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Accept the gifts he sends thee, and, thus crowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Depart content.' Penda with backward hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waved them far from him, and vouchsafed no word.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sadness they returned: but Oswy smiled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hearing their tale, and said: 'My part is done:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let God decide the event,' He spake, and took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The caskets twelve, and placed them, side by side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the altar of his chiefest church,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And vowed to raise to God twelve monasteries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In honour of our Lord's Apostles Twelve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On greenest upland, or in sylvan glade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where purest stream kisses the richest mead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His vow recorded, sudden through the church<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ran with fleet foot a lady mazed with joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crying, 'A maiden babe! and lo, the queen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Late dying lives and thrives!' That eve the king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bestowed on God the new-born maiden babe,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span><span class="i0">Laying her cradled 'mid those caskets twelve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Six at each side; and said: 'For her nor throne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor marriage bower! She in some holy house<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall dwell the Bride of Christ. But thou, just God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This day avenge my people!'<br /></span>
<span class="i32">Windwaed field<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard, distant still, that multitudinous foe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trampling the darksome ways. With pallid face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Morning beheld their standards, raven-black&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Penda had thus decreed, before him sending<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Northumbria's sentence. On a hill, thick-set<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood Oswy's army, small, yet strong in faith,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wedge-like phalanx, fenced by rocks and woods;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A river in its front. His standards white<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sustained the Mother-Maid and Babe Divine:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From many a crag his altars rose, choir-girt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And crowned by incense wreath.<br /></span>
<span class="i34">An hour ere noon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That river passed, in thunder met the hosts;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Penda, straitened by that hilly tract,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could wield not half his force. Sequent as waves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On rushed they: Oswy's phalanx like a cliff<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Successively down dashed them. Day went by:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last the clouds dispersed: the westering sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glared on the spent eyes of those Mercian ranks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which in their blindness each the other smote,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span><span class="i0">Or, trapped by hidden pitfalls, fell on stakes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And died blaspheming. Little help that day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gat they from Cambria. She on Heaven-Field height<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had felt her death-wound, slow albeit to die.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The apostate Ethelwald in panic fled:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The East Anglians followed. Swollen by recent rains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And choked with dead, the river burst its bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And raced along the devastated plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till cry of drowning horse and shriek of man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rang far and farther o'er that sea of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A battle-field but late. This way and that<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Briton or Mercian where he might escaped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through flood or forest. Penda scorned to fly:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrice with extended arms he met and cursed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fugitives on rushing. As they passed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He flung his crown√®d helm into the wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bit his brazen shield, above its rim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Levelling a look that smote with chill like death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their hearts that saw it. Yet one moment more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sat like statue on some sculptured horse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With upraised hand, close-clenched, denouncing Heaven:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then burst his mighty heart. As stone he fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dead on the plain. Not less in after times<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mercian to Mercian said, 'Without a wound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">King Penda died, although on battle-field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore with Odin Penda shares not feast.'<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span><span class="i0">Thus pagan died old Penda as he lived:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet Penda's sons were Christian, kindlier none;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His daughters nuns; and lamb-like Mercia's House,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lion one while, made end. King Oswy raised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His monasteries twelve: benigner life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around them spread: wild waste, and robber bands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vanished: the poor were housed, the hungry fed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Oswy sent his little new-born babe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dewed with her mother's tear-drops, Eanfleda,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like some young lamb with fillet decked and flower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet dedicated not to death, but life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Hilda sent on Whitby's sea-washed hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who made her Bride of Christ. The years went by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Oswy, now an old king, glory-crowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His country from the Mercian thraldom loosed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And free from north to south, in heart resolved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pilgrim, Romeward faring with bare feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make his rest by Peter's tomb and Paul's.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God willed not thus: within his native realm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sickness unto death clasped him with hold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gentle but firm. Long sleepless, t'ward the close<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid his wanderings smiling, from the couch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stretched a shrivelled hand, and pointing said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Who was it fabled she had died in age?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all her youthful beauty holy and pure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, where she kneels upon the wintry ground,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span><span class="i0">The snow-flakes circling round her, yet with face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright as a star!' so spake the king, and taking<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into his heart that vision, slept in peace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His daughter, abbess then on Whitby's height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within her church interred her father's bones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside her grandsire's, Edwin. Side by side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They rested, one Bernicia's king, and one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">D√´ira's&mdash;great Northumbrian sister realms;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long foes, yet blended by that mingling dust.<br /></span>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Osthryda, Queen of Mercia, translates the relics of her uncle,
Oswald of Northumberland, to the Abbey of Bardeney. The monks
refuse them admittance because King Oswald had conquered and kept
for one year Lindsay, a province of Mercia. Though hourly expecting
the destruction of their Abbey, they will yield neither to threats
nor to supplications, nor even to celestial signs and wonders. At
last, being convinced by the reasoning of a devout man, they repent
of their anger. </p></div>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Silent, with gloomy brows in conclave sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The monks of Bardeney, nigh the eastern sea;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rumour, that still outruns the steps of ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smote on their gates with news: 'Osthryda comes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bury here her royal uncle's bones,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Northumbrian Oswald.' Oswald was a Saint;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had loosed from Pagan bonds that Christian land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His own by right. But Oswald had subdued<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lindsay, a Mercian province; and the monks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were sons of Mercia leal and true. Osthryda,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span><span class="i0">Northumbrian born, had wedded Mercia's King;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore the monks of Bardeney pondered thus:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'This Mercian Queen spurns her adopted country!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must Mercia therefore build her conqueror's tomb?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though earth and hell cried "Ay," it should not be!'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus mused the brethren till the sun went down:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then lo! beyond a vista in the woods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew nigh a Bier, black-plumed, with funeral train:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thereon the stern monks gazed, and gave command<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To close the Abbey's gate. Beside that gate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tent-roofed that Bier remained.<br /></span>
<span class="i32">Before them soon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood up the royal herald. Thus he spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Ye sacred monks of Bardeney's Abbey, hail!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Osthryda, wife of Ethelred our King,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prays that God's peace may keep this House forever.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Queen has hither brought, by help of God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">King Oswald's bones, and sues for them a grave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within this hallowed precinct.' Answer came:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'King Oswald, living, was Northumbria's King;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">King Oswald, by the pride of life seduced,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrested from Mercia's sceptre Lindsay's soil;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore in Lindsay's soil King Oswald, dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May never find repose.'<br /></span>
<span class="i26">Before them next<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three earls advanced full-armed, and spake loud-voiced:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span><span class="i0">'Our Queen is consort of the Mercian King;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye, monks, are Mercian subjects! Sirs, beware!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our King and Queen have loved you well till now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ranked your abbey highest in their realm:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But hearts ingrate can sour the mood of love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Ethelred, though mild as summer skies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When mildly used, once angered'&mdash;&mdash;Answer came:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'We know it, and await our doom, content:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If Mercia's King contemns his realm, more need<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Mercia's priests her confessors should die:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Bardeney's church King Oswald ne'er shall rest:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye have your answer, Earls!'<br /></span>
<span class="i30">Through that dim hall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere long a gentler embassage made way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three priests; arrived, they knelt, and, reverent, spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Fathers and brethren, Oswald was a Saint!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He loosed his native land from pagan thrall:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Churches and convents everywhere he built:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His relics, year by year, grow glorious more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through miracles and signs. Fathers revered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within this sanctuary beloved of God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vouchsafe his dust interment!' They replied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'We know that Oswald is a Saint with God:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We know he freed his realm from pagan thrall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We know that churches everywhere he built;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We know that from his relics Grace proceeds<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span><span class="i0">As light from sun and moon. In heaven a crown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rests on Saint Oswald's head: yet here on earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">King Oswald's foot profaned our Mercian bound:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore in Mercian earth he finds not grave.'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Silent those priests withdrew. An hour well-nigh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went by in silence. Then with forehead crowned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mourner's veil, and step of one that mourns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Queen advanced, a lady at each side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And 'mid the circle stood, and thus implored:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Not as your Sovereign come I, holy Sirs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since all are equal in the House of God;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor stand I here a stranger. Many a day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this your church, I knelt, while yet a child;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then too, as now, within my breast there lived<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tenderest of its ardours and the best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Zeal for my kinsman's fame. That time how oft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I heard my Father, Oswy, cry aloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O Brother, had I walked but in thy ways<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My foot had never erred!" In maiden youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I met with one who shared my loyal zeal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mercian himself: 'twas thus he won my heart:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My royal husband shared it; shares this hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My trust that 'mid the altars reared by us<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To grace this chiefest Minster of our realm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May rest the relics of our household Saint&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span><span class="i2">She spake: benign and soft the answering voice:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Entreat us not, thou mourner true and kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest we, by pity from the straight path drawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sin more than thou. Thou know'st what thing love is,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus loving one who died before thy birth!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up to the measure of high love and fit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou lov'st him for this cause, because thy heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath never rested on base love and bad:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lady, a sterner severance monks have made:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not base and bad alone do they reject,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lesser good for better and for best:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore what yet remains they love indeed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A single earthly love is theirs unblamed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their Country! Lo, the wild-bird loves her nest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lions their caves:&mdash;to us God gave a Country.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What heart of man but loves that mother-land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose omnipresent arms are round him still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vale and plain; whose voice in every stream;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose breath his forehead cools; whose eyes with joy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Regard her offspring issuing forth each morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On duteous tasks; to rest each eve returning?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And who that loves her but must hate her foes?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lady, accept God's Will, nor strive by prayer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To change it. In our guest-house rest this night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou, and thy train.'<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i25">Severe the Queen replied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Yea, in thy guest-house I will lodge this night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unvanquished, undiscouraged, not to cease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From prayer: of that be sure. I make henceforth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My prayer to God, not man. To Him I pray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Lord of all, Who changes at His will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stony heart to flesh.'<br /></span>
<span class="i27">She spake: then turned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On those old faces, keenlier than before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her large slow eyes; and instant in her face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sadness deepened: but the wrath was gone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sadness said, 'Love then as deep as mine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grief like mine, in other breasts may spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From source how different!' Long she gazed, like child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That knows not she is seen to gaze, with looks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As though she took that hoary-headed band<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into her sorrowing heart. Silent she sighed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then passed into the guest-house with her train:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There prayed all night for him, that Saint in heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ill-honoured upon earth.<br /></span>
<span class="i26">Within their church<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime the monks the 'Dies Ir√¶' sang,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The yellow tapers ranged as round a corse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Penitential Psalms in order due.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their rite was for the living: ere the time<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span><span class="i0">They sang the obsequies of sentenced men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foreboding wrath to come. Sad Fancy heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flames up-rushing o'er their convent home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ruin of their church late-built, the wreck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It might be of their Order. Fierce they knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Mercian royal House! Against their King<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They hurled no ban: venial they deemed his crime:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'He moves within the limits of his right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though wrongly measuring right. He sees but this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His subjects break his laws. Some sin of youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It may be hides from him a right more high:'&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus spake they in their hearts.<br /></span>
<span class="i34">While rival thus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The brethren and the Queen sent up their prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sacred night hung midway in her course,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold, there fell from God tempest and storm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Buffeting that abbey's walls. The woods around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Devastated by stress of blast on blast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Howled like the howling of wild beasts when fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invests their ambush, and their cubs late-born<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blaze in red flame. Trembling, the strong-built towers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Echoed the woodland moans. All night the Queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Propped by those two fair Seraphs, Faith and Love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prayed on in hope, or hearing not that storm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or mindful that where danger most abounds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There God is nearest still. Meantime the Tent<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span><span class="i0">Covering that royal Bier, unshaken stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside the unyielding abbey-gates close-barred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like something shielded by a heavenly charm:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When morning came, shattered all round it lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both trunk and bough; but in the rising sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The storm-drop shook not on that snowy shrine.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Things wondrous more that Legend old records:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An hour past sunrise from the meads and moors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came wide-eyed herdsmen thronging, with demand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'What means this marvel? All the long still night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While heaven and earth were dark, and peaceful sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Closed in her arms the wearied race of men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keeping our herds on meads and moorlands chill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We saw a glittering Tent beside your gates:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above it, and not far, a pillar stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All light, and high as heaven!' The abbot answered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Fair Sirs, ye dreamed a dream; and sound your sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Untroubled by the terror of the storm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereof those woodland fragments witness still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a forest patriarch prostrate laid:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There rose no pillar by our gates: yon Tent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood there, and stood alone.' In two hours' space<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shepherds arrived, from hills remoter sped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making the same demand. With eye ill pleased<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus answered brief the prior: 'Friends, ye jest!'<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span><span class="i0">And they in wrath departed. Once again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came foresters from Lindsay's utmost bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On horses blown, and spake: 'O'er yonder Tent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through all the courses of the long still night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold, a shining pillar hovering stood:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It rained a glory on your convent walls:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It flung a trail of splendour o'er your woods:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We watched it hour by hour. Like Oswald's Cross<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Heaven-Field planted in the days of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It waxed in height:&mdash;the stars were quenched.' Replied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With reddening brows the youngest of those monks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Sirs, ye have had your bribe, and told your tale:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Depart!' and they departed great in scorn.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Long time the brethren sat; discoursed long time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each with his neighbour. 'Craft of man would force<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dishonest deed on this our holy House,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By miracles suborned;' thus spake the first:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The second answered, 'Ay, confederates they!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The good Queen knew not of it:' then the third,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Not so! these men are simple folks, I ween:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor time for fraud had they. What sail is yon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So weather-worn that nears the headland?' Soon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pilot stood before them; at his side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A priest, long years an inmate of their House,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But late a pilgrim in the Holy Land.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span><span class="i0">Their greetings over, greetings warm and kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus spake the Pilgrim: 'Brothers mine, rejoice;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our God is with us! For our House I prayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three times with forehead on the Tomb of Christ;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Last night there came to me, in visible form,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An answer to that prayer. All day our ship,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before a great wind rushed t'ward Mercian shores:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To them I turned not: on the East I gazed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O happy East," I mused, "O Land, true home<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of every Christian heart! The Saviour's feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy streets, thy cornfields trod! With these compared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our country's self seems nothing!" In my heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Imaged successive, rose once more those sites<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Capernaum, Nain, Bethsaida, Bethlehem&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where'er my feet had strayed. At midnight, cries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wonder rang around me, and I turned:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw once more our convent on its hill:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw beside its gate a Tent snow-white;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw a glittering pillar o'er that Tent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twixt heaven and earth suspense! Serene it shone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such pillar as led forth the Chosen Race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By night from Egypt's coasts. From wave to wave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moon-like it paved a path! I cried, "Thank God!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For who shall stay yon splendour till it reach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Syrian shore? England," I said, "my country,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall lay upon Christ's Tomb a hand all light,<br /></span>

<span class="i30">When ceased that voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There fell upon the monks a crisis strange;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where that Pilgrim looked for joy, behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doubt, wrath, and anguish! Faces old long since<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grew older, stricken as by hectic spasm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fierce a pang had clutched them by the throat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While drops of sweat on many a wrinkled brow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hung large like dewy beads condensed from mist<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On cliffs by torrents shaken. Mute they sat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then sudden rose, uplifting helpless hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when from distant rock sore-wounded men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who all day long have watched some dreadful fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold it lost, or else foresee it lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with it lost their country's hearths and homes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet can bring no succour. Thus with them&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They knew themselves defeated; deemed the stars<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of heaven had fought against them in their course;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet still believed, and could not but believe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their cause the cause of Justice, and its wreck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wreck of priestly honour, patriot faith:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last the youngest of the brethren spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Come what come may, God's monks must guard the Right.'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Death-like a silence on that conclave fell&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span><span class="i0">Then rose a monk white-headed, well-nigh blind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Esteemed a Saint, who had not uttered speech<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since came the tidings of the Queen's resolve:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Low-voiced he spake, with eyes upon the ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And inward smile that dimly reached his lips:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Brethren, be wary lest ye strive with God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through wrath, that blind incontinence of age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what He wills He works. By passion warped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye deem this trial strange, this conflict new,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yourselves doomed men that stand between two Fates,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On one side right, on one side miracles!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brethren, the chief of miracles is this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That knowing what ye know ye know no more:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye know long since that Oswald is a Saint:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye know the sins of Saints are sins forgiven:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What then? Shall man revenge where God forgives?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be wroth with those He loves? Ye, seeing much,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See not the sun at noontide! God last night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sent you in love a miracle of love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To quell in you a miracle of wrath:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Discern its import true!<br /></span>
<span class="i26">Sum up the past!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus much is sure: we heard those thunder peals<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unheard by hind or shepherd, near or far:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis sure not less that light the shepherds saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We saw not; neither we nor yet the Queen<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span><span class="i0">What then? Is God not potent to divulge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thing He wills, or hide it? Brethren, God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrouding from us that beam far dwellers saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Admonished us perchance that far is near;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ofttimes distance makes intelligible<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What, nigh at hand, is veiled. This too He taught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That when Northumbrian foot our Mercia spurned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The men who saw that ruin saw not all:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The light of Christ drew near us in that hour;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His pillar o'er us stood, and in our midst:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pang, the shame, were transient. See the whole!'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The old man paused a space, and then resumed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Brethren, that day our country suffered wrong:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One day she may inflict it. Years may bring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The aggressor of past time a penitent grief;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wronged may meet her penitence with scorn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Guiltier through malice than her foe's worst rage:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were it not well to leave that time unborn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Magnanimous ensample? Hard it were<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lay in Mercian earth the unforgiven:<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Wholly</i> to pardon&mdash;that I deem not hard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My voice is this: forgive we Oswald's sin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lay his relics in our costliest shrine!'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus spake the aged man. That self-same eve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The western sun descending, while the church,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grey shaft transfigured by the glow divine,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span><span class="i0">Grey wall in flame of light pacific washed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone out all golden like that flower all gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which shoots through sunset airs an arrowy beam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In charity perfected moved the monks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No longer sad, a long procession forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With foreheads smoothed as by the kiss of death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And eyes like eyes of Saints from death new risen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bearing the relics of Northumbria's King,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oswald, the man of God. Behind them paced<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warriors and chiefs; Osthryda last, the Queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With face whereon that great miraculous light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By her all night unseen, appeared to rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And foot that might have trod the ocean waves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unwetted save its palm. A shrine gem-wrought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Received the royal relics. O'er them drooped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Northumbria's standard, guest of Mercian airs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through which it once had sailed, a portent dire:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whosoe'er in after centuries knelt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Oswald's grave, and, praying, wooed his prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Departed, in his heart the peace of God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passions corrupt expelled, and demon snares,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Irreverent love, and anger past its bound.<br /></span>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Saint Cuthbert while a boy wanders among the woods of Northumbria,
bringing solace to all. Later he lives alone in the island of
Farne. Being made bishop, many predict that he will be able neither
to teach his people nor to rule his diocese. His people flock to
him gladly, but require that he should teach them by parable and
tale. This he does, and likewise rules his diocese with might. He
discourses concerning common life. Keeping his Pentecost at
Carlisle, he preaches on that Feast and the Resurrection from the
Dead. Herbert, an eremite, beseeching him that the two may die the
same day, he prays accordingly, and they die the same hour. </p></div>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Saint Cuthbert, yet a youth, for many a year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Walked up and down the green Northumbrian vales<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well loving God and man. The rockiest glens<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And promontories shadowing loneliest seas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where lived the men least cared for, most forlorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sought, and brought to each the words of peace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where'er he went he preached that God all Love;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span><span class="i0">For, as the sun in heaven, so flamed in him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That love which later fired Assisi's Saint:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, rumour ran that every mountain beast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Obeyed his loving call; that when all night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knelt upon the frosty hills in prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hare would couch her by his naked feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And warm them with her fur. To manhood grown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He dwelt in Lindisfarne; there, year by year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prospering yet more in vigil and in fast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And paced its shores by night, and blent his hymns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With din of waves. Yet ofttimes o'er the strait<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He passed, once more in search of suffering men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wafting them solace still. Where'er he went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those loved as children first, again he loved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As youth and maid, and in them nursed that Faith<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through which pure youth passes o'er passion's waves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like Him Who trod that Galilean sea:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He clasped the grey-grown sinner in his arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And won from him repentance long delayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then with him shared the penance he enjoined.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O heart both strong and tender! offering Mass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Awe-struck he stood as though on Calvary's height:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The men who marked him shook.<br /></span>
<span class="i30">Twelve winters passed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then mandate fell upon the Saint from God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or breathed upon him from the heavenly height,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span><span class="i0">Or haply from within. It drave him forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hermit into solitudes more stern.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Farewell,' he said, 'my brethren and my friends!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No holier life than yours, pure C&oelig;nobites<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pacing one cloister, sharing one spare meal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chanting to God one hymn! yet I must forth&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Farewell, my friends, farewell!' On him they gazed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And knew that God had spoken to his soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And silent stood, though sorrowing.<br /></span>
<span class="i38">Long that eve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The brethren grieved, noting his vacant stall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet thus excused their sadness: 'Well for him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And high his place in heaven; but woe to those<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Henceforth of services like his amerced!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here lived he in the world; here many throng;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To him in time some lesser bishopric<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might well have fallen, behoof of countless souls!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such dream is past forever!'<br /></span>
<span class="i32">Forth he fared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Farne, a little rocky islet nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where man till then had never dared to dwell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By dreadful rumours scared. In narrow cave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worn from the rock, and roughly walled around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The anchoret made abode, with lonely hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raising from one poor strip his daily food,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Barley thin-grown, and coarse. He saw by day<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span><span class="i0">The clouds on-sailing, and by night the stars;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heard the eternal waters. Thus recluse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The man lived on in vision still of God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through contemplation known: and as the shades,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each other chase all day o'er steadfast hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even so, athwart that Vision unremoved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forever rushed the tumults of this world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Man's fleeting life, the rise and fall of states,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While changeless measured change; the spirit of prayer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fanning that wondrous picture oft to flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until the glory grew insufferable.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long years thus lived he. As the Apostle Paul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though raised in raptures to the heaven of heavens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not therefore loved his brethren less, but longed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To give his life&mdash;his all&mdash;for Israel's sake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Cuthbert, loving God, loved man the more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His wont of old. To him the mourners came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sinners bound by Satan. At his touch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their chains fell from them light as summer dust:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each word he spake was as a Sacrament<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clothed with God's grace; beside his feet they sat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in their perfect mind; thence through the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bare their deliverer's name.<br /></span>
<span class="i30">So passed his life:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There old he grew, and older yet appeared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By fasts outworn, though ever young at heart;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span><span class="i0">When lo! before that isle a barge there drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bearing the royal banner. Egfrid there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With regal sceptre sat, and many an earl,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a mitred bishop at his side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Northumbria's see was void: a council's voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Joined with a monarch's called him to its throne:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain he wept, and knelt, and sued for grace:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Six months' reprieve alone he won; then ruled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Lindisfarne, chief Bishop of the North.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But certain spake who deemed that they were wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fools all beside: 'Shall Cuthbert crosier lift?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A child, 'tis known he herded flocks for hire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Housed in old Renspid's hut, his Irish nurse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who told him tales of Leinster Kings, his sires,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how her hands, their palace wrecked in war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had snatched him from its embers. Yet a boy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He rode to Melrose and its wondering monks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mimic warrior, in his hand a lance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With shepherd youth for page, and spake: "'Tis known<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Christ's kingdom is a kingdom militant:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A son of Kings I come to guard His right<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And battle 'gainst his foes!" For lance and sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A book they gave him; and they made him monk:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Savage since then he couches on a rock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As fame reports, with birds' nests in his beard!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Move where he may, that slowly wandering eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will see in man no more than kites or hawks;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men, if they note, will flee him.' Thus they buzzed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Self-praised, and knowing not that simpleness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is sacred soil, and sown with royal seed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heroic seed and saintly.<br /></span>
<span class="i30">Mitred once<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such gibes no more assailed him: one short month<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sufficed the petty cavil to confute;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One month well chronicled in book which verse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Late born, alas, in vain would emulate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once he called to mind the days that were;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His wanderings in Northumbrian glens; the hearths<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That welcomed him so joyously; at once<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within his breast the heart parental yearned;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He longed to see his children, scattered wide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Humber's bank to Tweed, from sea to sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cried to those around him: 'Let us forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And visit all my charge; and since Carlisle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remotest sits upon its western bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keep there this year our Pentecost!' Next day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He passed the sands, left hard by ebbing tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His cross-bearer and brethren six in front,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And trod the mainland. Reverent, first he sought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His childhood's nurse, and 'neath her humble roof<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span><span class="i0">Abode one night. To Melrose next he fared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Honouring his master old.<br /></span>
<span class="i26">Southward once more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Returning, scarce a bow-shot from the woods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There rode to him a mighty thane, one-eyed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With warriors circled, on a jet-black horse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Barbaric shape and huge, yet frank as fierce,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who thus made boast: 'A Jute devout am I!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What raised that convent-pile on yonder rock?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This hand! I wrenched the hillside from a foe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By force, and gave it to thy Christian monks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To spite yet more those Angles! Island Saint,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unprofitable have I found thy Faith!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold, those priests, thy thralls, are savage men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unrighteous, ruthless! For a sin of mine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They laid on me a hundred days of fast!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A man am I keen-witted: friend and liege<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I summoned, shewed my wrong, and ended thus:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Sirs, ye are ninety-nine, the hundredth I;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I counsel that we share this fast among us!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To-morrow from the dawn to evening's star<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No food as bulky as a spider's tongue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall pass our lips; and thus in one day's time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My hundred days of fast shall stand fulfilled."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrathful they rose, and sware by Peter's keys<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That fight they would, albeit 'gainst Peter's self;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span><span class="i0">But fast they would not save for personal sins.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Signal I made: then backward rolled the gates,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, captured thus, they fasted without thanks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cancelling my debt&mdash;a hundred days in one!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beseech you, Father, chide your priests who breed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Contention thus 'mid friends!' The Saint replied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Penance is irksome, Thane: to 'scape its scourge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ways are there various; and the easiest this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keep far from mortal sin.'<br /></span>
<span class="i28">Where'er he faced,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The people round him pressed&mdash;the sick, the blind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young mothers sad because a babe was pale;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Likewise the wives of fishers, praying loud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their husbands' safe return. Rejoiced he was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see them, hear them, touch them; wearied never:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whate'er they said delighted still he heard:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rise and fall of empires touched him less,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The book rich-blazoned, or the high-towered church:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'We have,' he said, 'God's children, and their God:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rest is fancy's work.' Him too they loved;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loved him the more because, so great and wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stumbled oft in trifles. Once he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'How well those pine-trees shield the lamb from wind!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A smile ran round; at last the boldest spake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Father, these are not pine-trees&mdash;these are oaks.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Cuthbert answered, 'Oaks, good sooth, they are!<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span><span class="i0">In youth I knew the twain apart: the pine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wears on his head the Cross.' Instruction next<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gave them, how the Cross had vanquished sin:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then first abstruse to some appeared his words.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Father,' they answered, 'speak in parables!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For pleasant is the tale, and, onward passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keeps in our hearts thy lesson.'<br /></span>
<span class="i34">While they spake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A youth rich-vested tossed his head and cried:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Father, why thus converse with untaught hinds?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their life is but the life of gnats and flies:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They think but of the hour. Behold yon church!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I reared it both for reverence of thy Christ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And likewise that through ages yet to come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My name might live in honour!' At that word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cuthbert made answer: 'Hear the parable!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My people craved for such.<br /></span>
<span class="i28">A monk there lived<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holiest of men reputed. He was first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On winter mornings in the freezing stall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meekest when chidden; fervent most in prayer:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, late in life, when heresies arose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That book he wrote, like tempest winged from God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drave them to darkness back. Grey-haired he died;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With honour was interred. The years went by;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His grave they opened. Peacefully he slept,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span><span class="i0">Unchanged, the smile of death upon his lips:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the right hand alone, for so it seemed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had Death retained his power: five little lines,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">White ashes, showed where once the fingers lay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All saw it&mdash;simple, learned, rich and poor:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None might divine the cause. That night, behold!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Saintly Shape beside the abbot stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright like the sun except one lifted palm&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thereon there lay a stain. 'Behold that hand!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Spirit spake, 'that, toiling twenty years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sent forth that book which pacified the world;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For it the world would canonise me Saint!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See that ye do it not! Inferior tasks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wrought for God alone. Building that book<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too oft I mused, "Far years will give thee praise."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I expiate that offence.'<br /></span>
<span class="i26">Another day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sweet-faced woman raised her voice, and cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Father! those sins denounced by God I flee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet tasks imposed by God too oft neglect:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stands thus a soul imperilled?' Cuthbert spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Ye sued for parables; I speak in such,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though ill, a language strange to me, and new.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There lived a man who shunned committed sin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet daily by omission sinned and knew it:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his own way, not God's, he served his God;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span><span class="i0">And there was with him peace; yet not God's peace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So passed his youth. In age he dreamed a dream:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He dreamed that, being dead, he raised his eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw a mountain range of frozen snows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heard, "Committed sins innumerable<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though each one small&mdash;so small thou knew'st them not&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uplifted, flake by flake as sin by sin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yon barrier 'twixt thy God and thee! Arise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remembering that of sins despair is worst:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be strong, and scale it!" Fifty years he scaled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those hills; so long it seemed. A cavern next<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Entering, with mole-like hands he scooped his way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And reached at last the gates of morn. Ah me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A stone's cast from him rose the Tree of Life:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He heard its sighs ecstatic: Full in view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Beatific River rolled; beyond<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All-glorious shone the City of the Saints<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clothed with God's light! And yet from him that realm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was severed by a gulf! Not wide that strait;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seemed a strong man's leap twice told&mdash;no more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, as insuperably soared that cliff,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unfathomably thus its sheer descent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Walled the abyss. Again he heard that Voice:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Henceforth no place remains for active toils,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Penance for acts perverse. Inactive sloth<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span><span class="i0">Through passive suffering meets its due. On earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sloth a nothing seemed; a nothing now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That chasm whose hollow bars thee from the Blest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor slender film of insubstantial air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Self-help is here denied thee; for that cause<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A twofold term thou need'st of pain love-taught<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To expiate Love that lacked." That term complete<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An angel caught him o'er that severing gulf:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thenceforth he saw his God.'<br /></span>
<span class="i29">With such discourse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Progress, though slow and interrupted oft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Saint of God, by no delay perturbed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made daily through his sacred charge. One eve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He walked by pastures arched along the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With many companied. The on-flowing breeze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glazed the green hill-tops, bending still one way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glossy grasses: limitless below<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ocean mirror, clipped by cape or point<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With low trees inland leaning, lay like lakes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flooding rich lowlands. Southward far, a rock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Touched by a rainy beam, emerged from mist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shone, half green, half gold. That rock was Farne:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though strangers, those that kenned it guessed its name:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Doubtless 'twas there,' they said, 'our Saint abode!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then pressed around him, questioning: 'Rumour goes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Father beloved, that in thine island home<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span><span class="i0">Thou sat'st all day with hammer small in hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shaping, from pebbles veined, miraculous beads<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That save their wearers still from sword and lance:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are these things true? 'Smiling the Saint replied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'True, and not true! That isle in part is spread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With pebbles divers-fashioned, some like beads:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I gathered such, and gave to many a guest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adding, "Such beads shall count thy nightly prayers;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pray well; then fear no peril!"'<br /></span>
<span class="i32">Others came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus demanded: 'Rumour fills the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Father, that birds miraculous crowned thine isle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And awe-struck let thee lift them in thy hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though scared by all beside.' Smiling once more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Saint made answer, 'True, and yet not true!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sea-birds elsewhere beheld not throng that isle;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A breed so loving and so firm in trust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, yet unharmed by man, they flee not man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wondering they gaze; who wills may close upon them!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I signed a league betwixt that race and man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pledging the mariners who sought my cell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To reverence still that trust.' He ended thus:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'My friends, ye seek me still for parables;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seek them from Nature rather:&mdash;here are two!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those pebble-beads are words from Nature's lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exhorting man to pray; those fearless birds<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span><span class="i0">Teach him that trust to innocence belongs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By right divine, and more avails than craft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shield us from the aggressor.' Some were glad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hearing that doctrine; others cried, 'Not so!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our Saint&mdash;all know it&mdash;makes miraculous beads;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, being humble, he conceals his might:'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many an age, when slept that Saint in death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passing his isle by night the sailor heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saint Cuthbert's hammer clinking on the rock;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And age by age men cried, 'Our Cuthbert's birds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Revere the Saint's command.'<br /></span>
<span class="i28">While thus they spake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A horseman over moorlands near the Tweed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made hasty way, and thus addressed the Saint:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Father, Queen Ermenburga greets thee well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this her message:&mdash;"Queen am I forlorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long buffeted by many a storm of state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And worn at heart besides; for in our house<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peace lived not inmate, but a summer guest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now, my lord, the King is slain in fight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And changed the aspect now things wore of old:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou therefore, man of God, approach my gates<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With counsel sage. This further I require;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy counsel must be worthy of a Queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor aught contain displeasing."' Cuthbert spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'My charge requires my presence at Carlisle;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span><span class="i0">Beseech the Queen to meet me near its wall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On this day fortnight.'<br /></span>
<span class="i24">Thitherwards thenceforth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swiftlier he passed, while daily from the woods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The woodmen flocked, and shepherds from the hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Concourse still widening. These among there moved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hermit meek as childhood, calm as eld,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long years Saint Cuthbert's friend. Recluse he lived<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within a woody isle of that fair lake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Derwent lulled and Greta. Others thronged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round Cuthbert's steps; that hermit stood apart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With large dark eyes upon his countenance fixed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pale cheek dewed with tears. The name he bore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was 'Herbert of the Lake.'<br /></span>
<span class="i28">Two weeks went by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Cuthbert reached his journey's end. Next day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God sent once more His Feast of Pentecost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To gladden men; and all His Church on earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone out, irradiate as by silver gleams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flashed from her whiter Sister in the skies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every altar laughed, and every hearth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a simple hind in spirit heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wind which through that 'upper chamber' swept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Careering through the universe of God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New life through all things poured. Cuthbert that day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Borne on by wing√®d winds of rapturous thought,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span><span class="i0">Forth from Carlisle had fared alone, and reached<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere long a mead tree-girded;&mdash;in its midst<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swift-flowing Eden raced from fall to fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Showering at times her spray on flowers as fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As graced that earlier Eden; flowers so light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each feeblest breath impalpable to man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now shook them and now swayed. Delighted eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Saint upon them fixed. Ere long he gazed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As glad on crowds thronging the river's marge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For now the high-walled city poured abroad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her children rich and poor. At last he spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Glory to Him Who made both flowers and souls!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He doeth all things well! A few weeks past<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yon river rushed by wintry banks forlorn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What decks it thus to-day? The voice of Spring!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She called those flowers from darkness forth: she flashed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her life into the snowy breast of each:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This day she sits enthroned on each and all:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thrones are myriad; but the Enthroned is One!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He paused; then, kindling, added thus: 'O friends!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis thus with human souls through faith re-born:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One Spirit calls them forth from darkness; shapes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One Christ, in each conceived, its life of life;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One God finds rest enthroned on all. Once more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thrones are many; but the Enthroned is One!'<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span><span class="i0">Again he paused, and mused: again he spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Yea, and in heaven itself, a hierarchy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is that glories in the name of "Thrones:"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The high cherubic knowledge is not theirs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not theirs the fiery flight of Seraph's love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all their restful beings they dilate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make a single, myriad throne for God&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Children, abide in unity and love!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So shall your lives be one long Pentecost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your hearts one throne for God!'<br /></span>
<span class="i34">As thus he spake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A breeze, wide-wandering through the woodlands near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Illumed their golden roofs, while louder sang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The birds on every bough. Then horns were heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resonant from stem to stem, from rock to rock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While moved in sight a stately cavalcade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flushing the river's crystal. Of that host<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foremost and saddest Ermenburga rode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Queen sad-eyed, with large imperial front<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By sorrow seamed: a lady rode close by;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind her earls and priests. Though proud to man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her inborn greatness made her meek to God:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She signed the Saint to stay not his discourse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And placed her at his feet.<br /></span>
<span class="i28">His words were great:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spake of Pentecost; no transient grace,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span><span class="i0">No fugitive act, consummated, then gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But God's perpetual presence in that Church<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er-shadowed still, like Mary, by His Spirit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fecundated in splendour by His Truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made loving through His Love. The reign of Love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He showed, though perfected in Christ alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not less co-eval with the race of man:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what is man? Not mind: the beasts can think:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not passions; appetites: the beasts have these:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, but Affections ruled by Laws Divine:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These make the life of man. Of these he spake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proclaimed of these the glory. These to man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are countless loves revealing Love Supreme:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These and the Virtues, warp and woof, enweave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A single robe&mdash;that sacrificial garb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worn from the first by man, whose every act<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of love in spirit was self-sacrifice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And prophesied the Sacrifice Eterne:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through these the world becomes one household vast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through these each hut swells to a universe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Traversed by stateliest energies wind-swift,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And planet-crowned, beneath their Maker's eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All hail, Affections, angels of the earth!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Woe to that man who boasts of love to God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet his neighbour scorns! While Cuthbert spake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A young man whispered to a priest, 'Is yon<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span><span class="i0">That Anchoret of the rock? Where learned he then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This loving reverence for the hearth and home?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mark too that glittering brow!' The priest replied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'What! shall a bridegroom's face alone be bright?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knows a better mystery! This he knows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, come what may, all o'er the earth forever<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God keeps His blissful Bridal-feast with man:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each true heart there is guest!'<br /></span>
<span class="i34">Once more the Saint<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arose and spake: 'O loving friends, my children,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Christ's sons, His flock committed to my charge!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I spake to you but now of humbler ties,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not highest, with intent that ye might know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How pierced are earthly bonds by heavenly beam;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, speaking with lame tongue in parables,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shewed you but similitudes of things&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twilight, not day. Make question then who will;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So shall I mend my teaching.'<br /></span>
<span class="i32">Prompt and bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As children issuing forth to holyday,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then flocked to Cuthbert's school full many a man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Successive: each with simpleness of heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His doubt propounded; each his question asked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, careless who might hear, confessed his sins,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And absolution won. Among the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little seven years' boy, with sweet, still face,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span><span class="i0">Yet strong not less, and sage, drew softly near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His great calm eyes upon the patriarch fixed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And silent stood. From Wessex came that boy:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By chance Northumbria's guest. Meantime a chief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Demanded thus: 'Of all the works of might,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What task is worthiest?' Cuthbert made reply:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'His who to land barbaric fearless fares,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And open flings God's palace gate to all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cries "Come in!"' That concourse thrilled for joy:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone that seven years' child retained the word:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rest forgat it. 'Winifrede' that day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men called him; later centuries, 'Boniface,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because he shunned the ill, and wrought the good:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In time the Teuton warriors knew that brow&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their great Apostle he: they knew that voice:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And happy Fulda venerates this day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her martyr's gravestone.<br /></span>
<span class="i26">Next, to Cuthbert drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three maidens hand in hand, lovely as Truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trustful, though shy: their thoughts, when hidden most,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wore but a semilucid veil, as when<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through gold-touched crystal of the lime new-leaved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On April morns the symmetry looks forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of branch and bough distinct. Smiling, they put<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last their question: 'Tell us, man of God,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span><span class="i0">What life, of lives that women lead, is best;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then show us forth in parables that life!'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He answered: 'Three; for each of these is best:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First comes the Maiden's: she who lives it well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Serves God in marble chapel white as snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His priestess&mdash;His alone. Cold flowers each morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She culls ere sunrise by the stainless stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lays them on that chapel's altar-stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sings her matins there. Her feet are swift<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All day in labours 'mid the vales below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cheering sad hearts: each evening she returns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To that high fane, and there her vespers sings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then sleeps, and dreams of heaven.'<br /></span>
<span class="i36">With witching smile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The youngest of that beauteous triad cried:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'That life is sweetest! I would be that maid!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cuthbert resumed: 'The Christian Wife comes next:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She drinks a deeper draught of life: round her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In ampler sweep its sympathies extend:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An infant's cry has knocked against her heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Evoking thence that human love wherein<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Self-love hath least. Through infant eyes a spirit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath looked upon her, crying, "I am thine!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Creature from God&mdash;dependent yet on thee!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thenceforth she knows how greatness blends with weakness;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span><span class="i0">Reverence, thenceforth, with pity linked, reveals<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To her the pathos of the life of man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thing divine, and yet at every pore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bleeding from crown√®d brows. A heart thus large<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath room for many sorrows. What of that?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its sorrow is its dowry's noblest part.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She bears it not alone. Such griefs, so shared&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sickness, and fear, and vigils lone and long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waken her heart to love sublimer far<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than ecstasies of youth could comprehend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lift her perchance to heights serene as those<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Ascetic treadeth.'<br /></span>
<span class="i24">'I would be that wife!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus cried the second of those maidens three:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet who that gazed upon her could have guessed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Creature so soft could bear a heart so brave?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She seemed that goodness which was beauteous too;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Virtue at once, and Virtue's bright reward;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Delight that lifts, not lowers us; made for heaven;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made too to change to heaven some brave man's hearth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She added thus: 'Of lives that women lead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell us the third!'<br /></span>
<span class="i20">Gently the Saint replied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'The third is Widowhood&mdash;a wintry sound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet, for her who widow is indeed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That winter something keeps of autumn's gold,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span><span class="i0">Something regains of Spring's first flower snow-white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Snow-cold, and colder for its rim of green.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She feels no more the warmly-greeting hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The eyes she brightened rest on her no more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her full-orbed being now is cleft in twain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her past is dead: daily from memory's self<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dear things depart; yet still she is a wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wife the more because of bridal bonds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lives but their essence, waiting wings in heaven;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More wife; and yet, in that great loneliness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More maiden too than when first maidenhood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lacked what it missed not. Like that other maid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She too a lonely Priestess serves her God;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, though her chapel be a funeral vault,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its altar black like Death;&mdash;the flowers thereon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tinct with the Blood Divine. Above that vault<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She hears the anthems of the Spouse of Christ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Widowed, like her, though Bride.'<br /></span>
<span class="i36">'O fair, O sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O beauteous lives all three; fair lot of women!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus cried again the youngest of those Three,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too young to know the touch of grief&mdash;or cause it&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A plant too lightly leaved to cast a shade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The eldest with pale cheek, and lids tear-wet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made answer sad: 'I would not be a widow.'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then Cuthbert spake once more with smile benign:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span><span class="i0">'I said that each of these three lives is best:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are who live those three conjoined in one:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nun thus lives! What maid is maid like her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, free to choose, has vowed a maidenhood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secure 'gainst chance or choice? What bride like her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose Bridegroom is the spouse of vestal souls?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What widow lives in such austere retreat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such hourly thought of him she ne'er can join<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save through the gate of death? If those three lives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In separation lived are fair and sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How show they, blent in one?'<br /></span>
<span class="i32">Of those who heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The most part gladdened; those who knew how high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Virtue, renouncing all besides for God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath leave to soar on earth. Yet many sighed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jealous for happy homesteads. Cuthbert marked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shame-faced sadness, and continued thus:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'To praise the nun reproaches not, O friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But praises best that life of hearth and home<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Cana blessed by Him who shared it not.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The uncloistered life is holy too, and oft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through changeful years in soft succession links<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those three fair types of woman; holds, diffused,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That excellence severe which life detached<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sustains in concentration.' Long he mused;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then added thus: 'When last I roved these vales<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span><span class="i0">There lived, not distant far, a blessed one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Revered by all: her name was Ethelreda:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I knew her long, and much from her I learned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath her Pagan father's roof there sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ofttimes a Christian youth. With him the child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Walked, calling him "her friend." He loved the maid:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still young, he drew her to the fold of Christ;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Espoused her three years later; died in war<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere three months passed. For her he never died!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Immortalised by faith that bond lived on;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now close by, and now 'mid Saints of heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She saw her husband walk. She never wept;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That fire which lit her eye and flushed her cheek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dried up, it seemed, her tears: the neighbours round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Called her "the lady of the happy marriage."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She died long since, I doubt not.' Forward stepped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A slight, pale maid, the daughter of a bard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And answered thus: 'Two months ago she died.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Cuthbert: 'Tell me, maiden, of her death;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And see you be not chary of your words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For well I loved that woman.' Tears unfelt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fast streaming down her pallid cheek, the maid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Replied&mdash;yet often paused: 'A sad, sweet end!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A long night's pain had left her living still:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I found her on the threshold of her door:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span><span class="i0">Her cheek was white; but, trembling round her lips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dimly o'er her countenance spread, there lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Something that, held in check by feebleness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet tended to a smile. A cloak tight-drawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the cold March wind screened her, save one hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stretched on her knee, that reached to where a beam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thin slip of watery sunshine, sunset's last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slid through the branches. On that beam, methought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rested her eyes half-closed. It was not so:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For when I knelt, and kissed that hand ill-warmed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smiling she said: "The small, unwedded maid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has missed her mark! You should have kissed the ring!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full forty years upon a widowed hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It holds its own. It takes its latest sunshine."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She lived through all that night, and died while dawned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through snows Saint Joseph's morn.'<br /></span>
<span class="i32">The Queen, with hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sudden and swift, brushed from her cheek a tear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a sob from that thick-crowding host<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confessed what tenderest love can live in hearts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Defamed by fools as barbarous. Cuthbert sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In silence long. Before his eyes she passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The maid, the wife, the widow, all in one;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With these,&mdash;through these&mdash;he saw once more the child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, saw the child's smile on the lips of death,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span><span class="i0">That magic, mystic, smile! O heart of man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What strange capacities of grief and joy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are thine! How vain, how ruthless such, if given<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For transient things alone! O life of man!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What wert thou but some laughing demon's scoff,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If prelude only to the eternal grave!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Deep cries to deep'&mdash;ay, but the deepest deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crying to summits of the mount of God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drags forth for echo, 'Immortality.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was the Death Divine that vanquished death!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shorn of that Death Divine the Life Divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Albeit its feeblest tear had cleansed all worlds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cancelled all guilt, had failed to reach and sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deepest in man's nature, Love and Grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Profoundest each when joined in penitent woe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Failed thence to wake man's hope. The loftiest light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flashed from God's Face on Reason's orient verge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Answers that bird-cry from the <i>Heart</i> of man&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor Heart that, darkling, kept so long its watch&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The auspice of the dawn.<br /></span>
<span class="i26">Like one inspired<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Saint arose, and raised his hands to God;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to his people turned with such discourse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As mocks the hand of scribe. No more he spake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In parables; adumbrated no more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Dimly as in a glass' his doctrine high,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span><span class="i0">But placed it face to face before men's eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Essential Truth, God's image, meet for man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself God's image. Worlds he showed them new,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worlds countless as the stars that roof our night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair fruitage of illimitable boughs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pushed from that Tree of Life from Calvary sprung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That over-tops and crowns the earth and man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Preached the Resurgent, the Ascended God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dispensing 'gifts to men.' The tongue he spake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed Pentecostal&mdash;grace of that high Feast&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all who heard, the simple and the sage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard still a single language sounding forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To all one Promise. From that careworn Queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who doffed her crown, and placed it on the rock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Murmuring, 'Farewell forever, foolish gaud,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To him the humblest hearer, all made vow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To live thenceforth for God. The form itself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of each was changed to saintly and to sweet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each countenance beamed as though with rays cast down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From fiery tongues, or angel choirs unseen.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus like high gods on mountain-tops of joy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those happy listeners sat. The body quelled&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all that body's might usurped to cramp<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through ceaseless, yet unconscious, weight of sense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conceptions spiritual, might more subtly skilled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than lusts avowed, to sap the spirit's life&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span><span class="i0">In every soul its nobler Powers released<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood up, no more a jarring crowd confused<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each trampling each and oft the worst supreme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not thus, but grade o'er grade, in order due,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pomp hierarchical. Yet hand in hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not severed, stood those Powers. To every Mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That truth new learned was palpable and dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not abstract nor remote, with cordial strength<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enclasped as by a heart; through every Heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Serene affections swam 'mid seas of light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reason's translucent empire without bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fountained from God. Silent those listeners sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Parleying in wordless thought. For them the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was lost&mdash;and won; its sensuous aspects quenched;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its heavenly import grasped. The erroneous Past<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay like a shrivelled scroll before their feet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweet as some immeasurable rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Expanding leaf on leaf, varying yet one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Everlasting Present round them glowed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dead was desire, and dead not less was fear&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fear of change&mdash;of death.<br /></span>
<span class="i32">An hour went by;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun declined: then rising from his seat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Herbert, the anchoret of the lonely lake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made humble way to Cuthbert's feet with suit:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'O Father, and O friend, thou saw'st me not;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span><span class="i0">Yet day by day thus far I tracked thy steps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At distance, for my betters leaving place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The great and wise that round thee thronged; the young<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who ne'er till then had seen thy face; the old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who saw it then, yet scarce again may see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Father, a happier lot was mine, thou know'st,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or had been save for sin of mine: each year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sought thy cell, thy words of wisdom heard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet still, alas! lived on like sensual men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who yield their hearts to creatures&mdash;fixing long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A foolish eye on gold-touched leaf, or flower&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not Him, the great Creator. Father and Friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The years run past. I crave one latest boon:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grant that we two may die the self-same day!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Cuthbert knelt, and prayed. At last he spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Thy prayer is heard; the self-same day and hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We two shall die.'<br /></span>
<span class="i20">That promise was fulfilled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For two years only on exterior tasks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God set His servant's hands&mdash;the man who 'sought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all things rest,' nor e'er had ceased from rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then when his task was heaviest. Two brief years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He roamed on foot his spiritual realm:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The simple still he taught: the sad he cheered:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where'er he went he founded churches still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And convents; yea, and, effort costlier far,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span><span class="i0">Spared not to scan defect with vigilant eye:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That eye the boldest called not 'vision-dazed';<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Saint he found no 'dreamer:' sloth or greed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Scaped not his vengeance: scandals hid he not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But dragged them into day, and smote them down:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before his face he drave the hireling priest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bandit thane: unceasing cried, 'Ye kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cease from your wars! Ye masters, loose your slaves!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two years sufficed; for all that earlier life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had trained the Ascetic for those works of might<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the attempt of all but boundless love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in him kept unspent the fire divine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never such Bishop walked till then the North,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor ever since, nor ever, centuries fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So lived in hearts of men. Two years gone by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His strength decayed. He sought once more his cell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sea-lulled; and lived alone with God; and saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more, like lights that sweep the unmoving hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God's providences girdling all the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With glory following glory. Tenderer-souled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Herbert meantime within his isle abode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At midnight listening Derwent's gladsome voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mingling with deep-toned Greta's, 'Mourner' named;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pacing, each day, the shore; now gazing glad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On gold-touched leaf, or bird that cut the mere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now grieved at wandering thoughts. For men he prayed;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span><span class="i0">And ever strove to raise his soul to God;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And God, Who venerates still the pure intent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgat not his; and since his spirit and heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holy albeit, were in the Eyes Divine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Less ripe than Cuthbert's for the Vision Blest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Least faults perforce swelling where gifts are vast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That God vouchsafed His servant sickness-pains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Virtue to perfect in a little space,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That both might pass to heaven the self-same hour.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It came: that sun which flushed the spray up-hurled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In cloud round Cuthbert's eastern rock, while he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within it dying chanted psalm on psalm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere long enkindled Herbert's western lake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The splendour waxed; mountain to mountain laughed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, brightening, nearer drew, and, nearing, clasped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That heaven-dropp'd beauty in more strict embrace:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cliffs successive caught their crowns of fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blencathara last. Slowly that splendour waned;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the glooming gorge of Borrodale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her purple cowl shadowing her holy head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the dim lake twilight with silent foot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stepped like a spirit. Herbert from his bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of shingles watched that sunset till it died;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at one moment from their distant isles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those friends, by death united, passed to God.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">'One love I; One: within His bridal bower<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My feet shall tread: One love I, One alone:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His Mother is a Virgin, and His Sire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The unfathomed fount of pureness undefiled:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him love I Whom to love is to be chaste:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him love I touched by Whom my forehead shines:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom she that clasps grows spotless more and more:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold, to mine His spirit He hath joined:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And His the blood that mantles in my cheek:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His ring is on my finger.'<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span><span class="i26">Thus she sang;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then walked and plucked a flower: she sang again:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'That which I longed for, lo, the same I see:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That which I hoped for, lo, my hand doth hold:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last in heaven I walk with Him conjoined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom, yet on earth, I loved with heart entire.'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus carolled Frideswida all alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Treading the opens of a wood far spread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around the upper waters of the Thames.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Christian almost by instinct, earth to her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was shaped but to sustain the Cross of Christ.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her mother lived a saint: she taught her child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From reason's dawn, to note in all things fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their sacred undermeanings. 'Mark, my child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In lamb and dove, not fleshly shapes,' she said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'But heavenly types: upon the robin's breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Revere that red which bathed her from the Cross<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With slender bill striving to loose those Nails!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dying, that mother placed within her hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A book of saintly legends. Thus the maid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grew up with mysteries clothed, with marvels fed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fearless creature swift as wind or fire:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But fires of hers were spirit-fires alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All else like winter moon. The Wessex King<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had gazed upon the glory of her face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And deemed that face a spirit's. He had heard<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span><span class="i0">Her voice; it sounded like an angel's song;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But wonder by degrees declined to love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such love as Pagans know. The unworthy suit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She scorned, from childhood spoused in heart to Christ:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She fled: upon the river lay a boat:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She rowed it on through forests many a mile;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A month had passed since then.<br /></span>
<span class="i32">Midsummer blazed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On all things round: the vast, unmoving groves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stretched silent forth their immemorial arms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arching a sultry gloom. Within it buzzed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feebly the insect swarm: the dragon-fly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stayed soon his flight: the streamlet scarce made way:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In shrunken pools, panting, the cattle stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Languidly browsing on the dried-up sprays:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No bird-song shook the bower. Alone that maid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glided light-limbed, as though some Eden breeze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hers only, charioted the songstress on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like those that serve the May. Beneath a tree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Low-roofed at last she sank, with eyes up-raised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On boughs that, ivy-twined and creeper-trailed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Darkened the shining splendour of the sky:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between their interspaces, here and there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It flashed in purple stars.<br /></span>
<span class="i28">Enraptured long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For admiration was to her as love,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span><span class="i0">The maiden raised at last her mother's book,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lit upon her childhood's favourite tale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Catherine in vision wed to Bethlehem's Babe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who from His Virgin-Mother leaning, dropped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His ring adown her finger. Princely pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pride not less of soaring intellect,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once in her were changed to pride of love:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain her country's princes sued her grace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kingdoms of earth she spurned. Around her seat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The far-famed Alexandrian Sages thronged,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Branding her Faith as novel. Slight and tall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Mid them, keen-eyed the wingless creature stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like daughter of the sun on earth new-lit:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Faith she shewed of all things first and last;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All lesser truths its prophets. Swift as beams<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth flashed such shafts of high intelligence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That straight their lore sophistic shrivelled up,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Christians they arose. The martyr's wheel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was pictured in the margin, dyed with red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And likewise, azure-tinct on golden ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her queenly throne in heaven. 'Ah shining Saint!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half weeping, smiling half, the virgin cried;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Yet dear not less thy sister of the West;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For never gaze I on that lifted face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or mark that sailing angel near her stayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But straight her solemn organs round me swell;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span><span class="i0">All discords cease.' Then with low voice she read<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Rome's Cecilia, her who won to Christ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(That earlier troth inviolably preserved)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her Roman bridegroom, wondering at that crown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invisible itself, that round her breathed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose-breath celestial; her that to the Church<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave her ancestral house; and, happier gift,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Devotion's heavenliest instrument of praise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her that, unfearing, dared that Roman sword;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when its work was done, for centuries lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like marble, 'mid the catacombs, unchanged,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sleep-resembling death.<br /></span>
<span class="i28">From earliest dawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That maiden's eyes had watched: wearied at noon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their silver curtains closed. Huge mossy roots<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pillowed her head, that slender book wide-leaved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In stillness, like some brooding, white-winged dove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spread on her bosom: 'gainst its golden edge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rested, gold-tinged, the dimpled ivory chin&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loud thunders broke that sleep; the tempest blast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came up against the woods, while bolt on bolt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ran through them sheer. She started up: she saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Pagan prince and many a sworded serf<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rushing towards her. Fleeter still she fled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, as some mountain beast tender and slight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, pasturing spring-fed lilies of Cashmere,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span><span class="i0">Or slumbering where its rock-nursed torrents fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sudden not distant hears the hunter's cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mocks pursuit at first, but slackens soon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breathless and spent, so failed her limbs ere long;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A horror of great faintness o'er her crept;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More near she heard their shout. She staggered on:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To threat'ning phantoms all things round were changed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About her towered in ruin hollow trunks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of spiked and branchless trees, survivors sole<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of woods that, summer-scorched, then lightning-struck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A century past, for one short week had blazed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blackened ever since. She knelt: she raised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her hands to God: she sued for holier prayer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saint Catherine, Saint Cecilia. At that word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind her close a cry of anguish rang:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silence succeeded. As by angels' help<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She reached a river's bank: sun-hardened clay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Retained the hoof-prints of the drinking herd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, shallower for long heats, the oxen's ford<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Challenged her bleeding feet. She crossed unharmed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soon in green-gold pastures girt by woods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood up secure. Then forth she stretched her hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like Agnes praising God amid the flame:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Omnipotent, Eternal, Worshipful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One God, Immense, and All-compassionate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou from the sinner's snare hast snatched the feet<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span><span class="i0">Of her that loved Thee. Glory to Thy name.'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thenceforth secure she roamed those woods and meads;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dwellers in that region brought her bread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon that countenance gazing, some with awe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all with love. To her the maidens came:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tell us,' they said, 'what mystery hast thou learned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So sweet and good;&mdash;thy Teacher, who was he;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grey-haired, or warrior young?' To them in turn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ceaseless she sang the praises of her Christ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His Virgin Mother and His heavenly court,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warriors on earth for justice. They for her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Renounced all else, the banquet and the dance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nuptial rites revered. A low-roofed house<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inwoven of branches 'mid the woods they raised;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There dwelt, and sang her hymn, and prayed her prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And loved her Saviour-Sovereign. Year by year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More high her bright feet scaled the heavenly mount<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of lore divine and knowledge of her God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with sublimer chant she hymned His praise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While oft some bishop, tracking those great woods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In progress to his charge, beneath their roof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Baptizing or confirming made abode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all which lacked supplied, nor discipline<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Withheld, nor doctrine high. The outward world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To them a nothing, made of them its boast:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Saint, it said, within that forest dwelt,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span><span class="i0">A Saint that helped their people. Saint she was,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And therefore wrought for heaven her holy deeds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Immortal stand they on the heavenly roll;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet fewest acts suffice for heavenly crown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And two of hers had consequence on earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like water circles widening limitless,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For man still helpful. Hourly acts of hers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Interior acts invisible to men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perchance were worthier. Humblest faith and prayer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are oft than miracle miraculous more:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To us the exterior marks the interior might:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These two alone record we.<br /></span>
<span class="i28">Years had passed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One day when all the streams were dried by heat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rainless fields had changed from green to brown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">T'wards her there drew, by others led, a man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old, worn, and blind. He knelt, and wept his prayer:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Help, Saint of God! That impious King am I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That King abhorred, his people's curse and bane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who chased thee through these woods with fell resolve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Worst vengeance seeking for insulted pride:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rememberest thou that, near thee as I closed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kneeling thou mad'st thy prayer? Instant from God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blindness fell on me. Forward still I rushed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere long amid those spiked and branded trunks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lie as lie the dead. If hope remains,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span><span class="i0">For me if any hope survives on earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It rests with thee; thee only!' On her knees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She sank in prayer; her fingers in the fount<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She dipped; then o'er him signed the Saviour's cross,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thrice invoked that Saviour. At her word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold, that sightless King arose, and saw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rendered thanks to God.<br /></span>
<span class="i28">The legend saith<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saint Catherine by her stood that night, and spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Once more I greet thee on thy dying day.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Again the years went by. That sylvan lodge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had changed to convent. Beautiful it stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not far from Isis, though on loftier ground:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sad outcasts knew it well: whate'er their need<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There found they solace. One day toward it moved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dread apparition and till then unknown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like one constrained, with self-abhorrent steps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A leper, long in forest caverns hid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back to their cells the nuns had shrunk, o'erawed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remained but Frideswida. Thus that wretch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With scarce organic voice, and aiding sign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wailed out the supplication of despair:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Fly not, O saintly virgin! Yet, ah me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What help though thou remainest? Warned from heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span><span class="i0">I know that not thy fountain's healing wave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could heal my sorrow: not those spotless hands:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not even thy prayer. To me the one sole aid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were aid impossible&mdash;a kiss of thine.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A moment stood she: not in doubt she stood:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First slowly, swiftly then to where he knelt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She moved: with steadfast hand she raised that cloth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which veiled what once had been a human face:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er it she signed in faith the cross of Christ:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She wept aloud, 'My brother!' Folding then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stainless to stained, with arms about him wound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sacred silence mouth to mouth she pressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A long, long sister's kiss. Like infant's flesh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blighted and the blasted back returned:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That leper rose restored.<br /></span>
<span class="i26">The legend saith<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Saint Cecilia by her stood that night:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Once more I greet thee on thy dying day.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">It came at last, that day. Her convent grew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In grace with God and man: the pilgrim old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sought it from far; the gifts of kings enlarged:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It came at last, that day. There are who vouch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The splendour of that countenance never waned:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus much is sure; it waxed to angels' eyes:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Welcomed it came, that day desired, not feared.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span><span class="i0">By humbleness like hers those two fair deeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were long forgotten: each day had its task:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not hardest that of dying. Why should sobs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trouble the quiet of a holy house<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because its holiest passes? Others wept;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sufferer smiled: 'Ah, little novices,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How little of the everlasting lore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your foolish mother taught you if ye shrink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From trial light as this!' She spake; then sank<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In what to those around her seemed but sleep,<br /></span>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Kenwalk, King of Wessex, is a Pagan, but refuses to persecute
Christians. He is dethroned by the Mercian King, and lives an exile
in a Christian land. There he boasts that he never accords faith to

single, he sees daily more of the Truth. Wessex is delivered, and a
great feast held at which the Pagan nobles, priests, and bards all
conspire for the destruction of the Faith. Birinus, the bishop,
having withstood them valiantly, Kenwalk declares himself a
Christian. Birinus prophesies of England's greatest King. </p></div>

<span class="i0">King Cynegils lay dead, who long and well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had judged the realm of Essex. By his bier<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Christians standing smote their breasts, and said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Ill day for us:' but all about the house<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clustering in smiling knots of twos and threes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sons of Odin whispered, or with nods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave glad assent. Christ's bishop sent from Rome,<br /></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span><span class="i0">The Joyous Tidings. Cynegils believed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with him many; but the most refrained:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With these was Kenwalk; and, his father dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kenwalk was king.<br /></span>
<span class="i22">A valiant man was he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A man of stubborn will, but yet at heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Magnanimous and just. To one who said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Strike, for thine hour is come!' the king new-crowned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made answer, 'Never! Each man choose his path!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My father chose the Christian&mdash;Odin's I.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I crossed my father oft a living man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I war not on him dead.'<br /></span>
<span class="i25">That giant hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which spared Religion ruled in all beside:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He harried forth the robbers from the woods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wrecked the pirates' ships. He burned with fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A judge unjust, and thrice o'er Severn drave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The invading Briton. Lastly, when he found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That woman in his house intolerable,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From bed and realm he hurled her forth, though crowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ensuing thence great peace.<br /></span>
<span class="i23">Not long that peace:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Mercian king, her brother, heard her tale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With blackening brow. The shrill voice stayed at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doubly incensed the monarch made reply:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span><span class="i0">'Sister, I never loved you;&mdash;who could love?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But him who spurned you from his realm I hate:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He spake; then cried, 'To arms!'<br /></span>
<span class="i37">In either land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like thunders low and far, or windless plunge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of waves on coasts long silent that proclaim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though calm the sea for leagues, tempest far off<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shoreward swells, thus day by day was heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The direful preparation for a war<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Destined no gladsome tournament to prove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But battle meet for ancient foes resolved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To clear old debts; make needless wars to come.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not long that strife endured; on either side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Valour was equal; but on one, conjoined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The skill most practised, and the heavier bones:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The many fought the few. On that last field<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas but the fury of a fell despair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not hope, that held the balance straight so long:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere sunset all was over. From the field<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wounded remnant dragged their king, half dead:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Mercian host pursued not.<br /></span>
<span class="i34">Many a week<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Low lay the broken giant nigh to death:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last, like creeping plant down-dragged, not crushed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, washed by rains, and sunshine-warmed, once more<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span><span class="i0">Its length uplifting, feels along the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gradual finds its 'customed prop, so he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strengthening each day, with dubious eyes at first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around him peered, but raised at length his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, later, question made. His health restored,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sought East Anglia, where King Anna reigned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His chief of friends in boyhood. Day by day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A spirit more buoyant to the exile came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And winged him on his way: his country's bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once passed, his darker memories with it sank:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through Essex hastening, stronger grew his step;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">East Anglian breezes from the morning sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fanned him to livelier pulse: wild April growths<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gladdened his spirit with glittering green. More fresh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He walked because the sun outfaced him not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Veiled, though not far. That shrouded sun had ta'en<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its passion from the wild-bird's song, but left<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quiet felicities of notes low-toned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That kept in tune with streams too amply brimmed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To chatter o'er their pebbles. Kenwalk's soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Partook not with the poet's. Loveliest sights,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like music brightening those it fails to charm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roused but his mirthful mood. To each that passed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He tossed his jest: he scanned the labourer's task;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reviled the luckless boor that ploughed awry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beat the smith that marred the horse's hoof:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span><span class="i0">At times his fortunes thus he moralised:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Here walk I, crownless king, and exiled man:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My Mercian brother lists his sister's tongue:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say, lark! which lot is happiest?'<br /></span>
<span class="i33">Festive streets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tapestries from windows waving, banners borne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By white-clad children chanting anthems blithe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With these East Anglia's king received his friend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Entering the city gate. In joyous sports<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That day was passed. At banquet Christian priests<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sat with his thanes commingled. Anna's court<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was Christian, and, for many a league around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His kingdom likewise. As the earth in May<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glistens with vernal flowers, or as the face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of one whose love at last has found return<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Irradiate shines, so shone King Anna's house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A home of Christian peace. Fair sight it was&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Justice and Love, the only rivals there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er-ruled it, and attuned. Majestic strength<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked forth in every glance of Anna's eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too great for pride to dwell there. Tender-souled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As that first streak, the harbinger of dawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Revealed through cloudless ether, such the queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All charity, all humbleness, all grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All womanhood. Harmonious was her voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dulcet her movements, undisguised her thoughts,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span><span class="i0">As though they trod an Eden land unfallen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And needed raiment none. Some heavenly birth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their children seemed, blameless in word and act,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sisters as their brothers frank, and they,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though bolder, not less modest. Kenwalk marked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And marking, mused in silence, 'Contrast strange<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These Christians with the pagan races round!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Something those pagans see not these have seen:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Something those pagans hear not these have heard:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doubtless there's much in common. What of that?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis thus 'twixt man and dog; yet knows the dog<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His master walks in worlds by him not shared&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perchance for me too there are worlds unknown!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Thus God to Kenwalk shewed the things that bear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of God true witness, seeing in his soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Justice and Judgment, and, with these conjoined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Valour and Truth: for as the architect<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On tower four-square and solid plants his spire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not on meads below, though gay with flowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On those four virtues God the fabric rears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of virtues loftier yet&mdash;those three, heaven-born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pointing heavenward.<br /></span>
<span class="i29">To those worlds unknown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kenwalk ere long stood nigh. In three short months<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The loveliest of those children, and last born,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span><span class="i0">Lay cold in death. Old nurses round her wailed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mighty heart of Kenwalk shook for dread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Entering the dim death-chamber. On a bier<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The maiden lay, the cross upon her breast:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside her sat her mother, pale as she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet calm as pale. When Kenwalk near her drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She lifted from that bier a slender book<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And read that record of the three days' dead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raised by the Saviour from that death-cave sealed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A living man. Once more she read those words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'I am the Resurrection and the Life,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then added, low, with eyes up cast to heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'With Him my child awaits me.' Kenwalk saw;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, what he saw, believing, half believed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not more&mdash;the things he heard.<br /></span>
<span class="i32">Yes, half believed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, call it obduracy, call it pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Call it self-fear, or fear of priestly craft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He closed his ear against the Word Divine:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thing he saw he trusted; nought beyond.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three years went by. Once, when his friend had named<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Name all-blessed, Kenwalk frowned. Since then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Name was named no more. O'er hill and dale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They chased the wild deer; on the billow breathed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inspiring airs; in hall of joyance trod<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mazes of the dance. Then war broke out:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span><span class="i0">Reluctant long King Anna sought the field;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hurled back aggression. Kenwalk, near him still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watched him with insight keener than his wont,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, wondering, marked him least to pagans like<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inly, when like perforce in outward deed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The battle frenzy took on him no hold:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Severe his countenance grew; austere and sad;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fatal, not wrathful. Vicar stern he seemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some dread, judgment-executing Power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against his yearnings; not despite his will.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once, when above the faithless town far off<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The retributive smoke leaped up to heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He closed with iron hand on Kenwalk's arm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And slowly spake&mdash;a whisper heard afar&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'See you that town? Its judgment is upon it!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I gave it respite twice. This day its doom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is irreversible.'<br /></span>
<span class="i18">The invader quelled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anna and Kenwalk on their homeward way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rode by the grave of saintly Sigebert,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">King Anna's predecessor. Kenwalk spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Some say the people keep but memory scant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of benefits: I trust the things I see:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I never passed that tomb but round it knelt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A throng of supplicants! King Sigebert<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conversed, men say, with prophet and with seer:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span><span class="i0">I never loved that sort:&mdash;who wills can dream&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet what I see I see.'<br /></span>
<span class="i22">'They pray for him,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anna replied, 'who perished for their sake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long years he lived recluse at Edmondsbury,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tonsured monk: around its walls one day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arose that cry, "The Mercian, and his host!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth, holy King, and lead, as thou wert wont,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy people to the battle, lest they die!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again I see him riding at their head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifting a cross, not sword. The battle lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again I see him fall.' With rein drawn tight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">King Kenwalk mused; then smote his hands, and cried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'My father would have died like Sigebert!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lacked but the occasion!' After pause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sad-faced, with bitter voice he spake once more:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Such things as these I might have learned at home!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shunned my father's house lest fools might say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'He thinks not his own thoughts.'<br /></span>
<span class="i34">Thus month by month,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though Faith which 'comes by hearing' had not come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Kenwalk yet, not less since sight he used<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In honest sort, and resolute to learn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God shewed him memorable things and great<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which sight unblest discerns not, tutoring thus<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span><span class="i0">A kingly spirit to a kingly part:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before him near it lay.<br /></span>
<span class="i24">The morrow morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great tidings came: in Wessex war was raised:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kenwalk, departing thus to Anna spake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Anna, and his consort: 'Well I know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What thanks are those the sole your hearts could prize:'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With voice that shook he added: 'Man am I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That make not pledge: yet, if my father's God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sets free my father's realm&mdash;&mdash;' again he paused;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then westward rode alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i26">Well planned, fought well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(For Kenwalk, of the few reverse makes wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From him had put his youth's precipitance)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That virtuous warfare triumphed. Swift as fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The news from Sherburne and from Winbourne flashed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Sarum, Chertsey, Malmsbury. That delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On earth the nearest to religious joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rapture of a trampled land set free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swelled every breast: the wounded in their wounds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rejoiced, not grieved: the sick forgat their pains:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mourner dashed away her tear and cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Wessex is free!' Remained a single doubt:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Christians crept forth from cave and hollow tree:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more the exiled monk was seen; and one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who long in minstrel's garb, with harp in hand,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span><span class="i0">Old, poor, half blind, had sat beside a bridge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, charming first the wayfarer with song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had won him next with legends of the Cross,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood up before his altar. Rumour ran<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Once more Birinus lifts his crosier-staff!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then muttered priests of Odin, 'Cynegils<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We know was Christian. Kenwalk holds&mdash;or held,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ancestral Faith, yet warred not on the new:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tolerance means still connivance.'<br /></span>
<span class="i34">Peace restored,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within King Kenwalk's echoing palace hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hall alike of council and of feast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Great Ones of the Wessex realm were met:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Birinus sat among them, eyed from far<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With anger and with hatred. Council o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Banquet succeeded, and to banquet song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Saxon's after-banquet. Many a harp<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That day by flying hand entreated well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Divulged its secret, amorous, or of war;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a warrior sang his own great deeds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or dirge of ancient friend Valhalla's guest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor stinted foeman's praise. Silent meanwhile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far down the board a son of Norway sat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ungenial guest with clouded brows and stern,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And eyes that flashed beneath them: bard was he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warrior and bard. Not his the song for gold!<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span><span class="i0">He sang but of the war-fields and the gods;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lays of love despised. 'Thy turn is come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Son of the ice-bound North,' thus spake a thane:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Sing thou! The man who sees that face, already<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half hears the tempest singing through the pines<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shade thy gulfs hill-girt.' The stranger guest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Answered, not rising: 'Yea, from lands of storm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seas cut through by fiery lava floods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I come, a wanderer. Ye, meantime, in climes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Balm-breathing, gorge the fat, and smell the sweet:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye wed the maid whose sire ye never slew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bask in unearned triumph. Feeble spirits!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Endless ye deem the splendours of this hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And call defeat opprobrious! Sirs, our life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is trial. Victory and Defeat are Gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That toss man's heart, their plaything, each to each:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great Mercia knows that truth&mdash;of all your realms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faithfullest to Odin far!'<br /></span>
<span class="i28">'Nay, minstrel, sing,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more, not wroth, they clamoured. He replied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Hear then my song; but not those songs ye sing:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have against you somewhat, Wessex men!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye are not as your fathers, when, in youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I trod your coasts. That time ye sang of Gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sole theme for manlike song. On Iceland's shores<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We keep our music's virtue undefiled:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span><span class="i0">While summer lasts we fight; by winter hearths,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or ranged in sunny coves by winter seas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt the snow-plains and the hills of fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Singing we feed on legends of the Gods:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye sing but triumphs of the hour that fleets;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye build you kingdoms: next ye dash them down:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye bow to idols! O that song of mine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might heal this people's wound!'<br /></span>
<span class="i34">Then rose the bard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And took his harp, and smote it like a man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sang full-blooded songs of Gods who spurn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their heaven to war against that giant race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Throned 'mid the mountains of old J√∂tunheim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That girdle still the unmeasured seas of ice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With horror and strange dread. Innumerable,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In ever-winding labyrinths, glacier-thronged,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those mountains raise their heads among the stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That palsied glimmer 'twixt their sunless bulks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er-shadowing seas and lands. O'er J√∂tunheim<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glittering car of day hath never shone:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There endless twilight broods. Beneath it sit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The huge Frost-Giants, sons of √ñrgelmir,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Themselves like mountains, solitary now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now grouped, with knees drawn up, and heads low bent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plotting new wars. Those wars the Northman sang;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thunder-like rang out the vast applause.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span><span class="i0">That hour Birinus whispered one close by:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Not casual this! Ill spirits, be sure, this day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And impious men will launch their fiercest bolts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To crush Christ's Faith for ever!'<br /></span>
<span class="i34">Jocund songs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bard sang next: how Thor had roamed disguised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through J√∂tunheim, and found the giant-brood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feasting; and how their king gave challenge thus:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Sir, since you deign us visit, show us feats!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold yon drinking horn! with us a child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drains it at draught.' The God inclined his head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swelled his lips; and three times drank: yet lo!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nigh full that horn remained, the dusky mead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In mockery winking! Spake once more the king:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Behold my youngest daughter's chief delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yon wild-cat grey! She lifts it: lift it thou!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The God beneath it slipped his arm and tugged,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tugging, ever higher rose and higher;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wild cat arched her back and with him rose;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But one foot left the ground! Last, forward stept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A haggard, lame, decrepid, toothless crone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cried, 'Canst wrestle, friend?' He closed upon her:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Firm stood she as a mountain: she in turn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Closed upon Thor, and brought him to one knee:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lower she could not bend him. Thor for rage<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span><span class="i0">Clenched both his fists until his finger-joints<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grew white as snow late fallen!<br /></span>
<span class="i32">Loud and long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The laughter rose: the minstrel frowned dislike:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'I have against you somewhat, Wessex men!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In laughter spasms ye reel, or shout applause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Music surceased. Like rocks your fathers sat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In every song they knew some mystery lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mystery of man or nature. Greater God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is none than Thor, whom, witless, thus ye flout.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That giant knew his greatness, and, at morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While vexed at failure through the gates he passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Addressed him reverent: 'Lift thy head, great Thor!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disguised thou cam'st; not less we knew thee well:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brave battle fought'st thou, seeming still to fail:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy foes were phantoms! Phantasies I wove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To snare thine eyes because I feared thy hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pledged thy strength to tasks impossible.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That horn thou could'st not empty was the sea!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At that third draught such ebb-tide stripp'd the shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As left whole navies stranded! What to thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wild-cat appeared was Midgard's endless snake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose infinite circle clasps the ocean round:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then when her foot thou liftedst, tremour went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From iron vale to vale of J√∂tunheim:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hadst thou but higher raised it one short span,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span><span class="i0">The sea had drowned the land! That toothless crone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was Age, that drags the loftiest head to earth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She bent thy knee alone. Come here no more!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On equal ground thou fight'st us in the light:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this, our native land, the stronger we,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mock thee by Illusions!'<br /></span>
<span class="i30">After pause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With haughty eye cast round, the minstrel spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Now hear ye mysteries of the antique song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though few shall guess their import!' Then he sang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Legends primeval of that Northern race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dread beginnings of the heavens and earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, save the shapeless chaos, nothing was:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ymer first, by some named √ñrgelmir,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The giant sire of all the giant brood:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him for his sins the sons of B√∂r destroyed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then fashioned of his blood the seas and streams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of his bones the mountains; of his teeth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cliffs firm set against the aggressive waves;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Last, of his skull the vast, o'er-hanging heaven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of his brain the clouds.<br /></span>
<span class="i30">'Sing on,' they cried:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next sang he of that mystic shape, earth-born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wondrous cow, Auhumla. Herb that hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was none, nor forest growth; yet on and on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She wandered by the vapour-belted seas,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span><span class="i0">And, wandering, from the stones and icebergs cold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That creaked forlorn against the grey sea-crags,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She licked salt spray, and hoary frost, and lived;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ever where she licked sprang up, full-armed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men fair and strong!<br /></span>
<span class="i22">Once more they cried, 'Sing on!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Last sang the minstrel of the Night and Day:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Car-borne they sweep successive through the heaven:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First rides the dusky maid by men called Night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sleep-bringing, pain-assuaging, kind to man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With dream-like speed cleaving the starry sphere:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hrimfaxi is her horse: his round complete<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foam from his silver bit bespangles earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mortals call it 'Morn.' Day follows fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her brother white: Skinfaxi is his horse:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When forth he flings the splendours from his mane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both Gods and men rejoice.<br /></span>
<span class="i28">Thus legends old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Northman sang, till, fleeting from men's eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The present lived no longer. In its place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He fixed that vision of the world new formed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which on the childhood of the Northern mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like endless twilight lay;&mdash;spaces immense;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unmeasured energies of fire and flood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great Nature's forces, terrible yet blind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In ceaseless strife alternately supreme,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span><span class="i0">Or breast to breast with dreadful equipoise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In conflict pressed. Once more o'er those that heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He hung that old world's low, funereal sky:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before their eyes he caused its cloud to stream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shadowing infinitude. He spake no word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like Heida of that war 'twixt Good and Ill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That peace which crowns the just; that God unknown:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enough to him his Faith without its soul!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With glorying eye he marked that panting throng;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, sudden, changed his note. Again of war<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sang, but war no more of Gods on Gods;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sang the honest wars of man on man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Odin, king of men, ere yet, death past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He flamed abroad in godhead. Field on field<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sang his battles; traced from realm to realm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His conquering pilgrimage: then ended, fierce:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'What God was this&mdash;that God ye honoured once?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What man was this&mdash;your half-forgotten king?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your law-giver he was! he framed your laws!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your poet he: he shaped your earliest song!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your teacher he: he taught you first your runes!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your warrior&mdash;yours! His warfare consummate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For you he died! Old age at last, sole foe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unvanquished, found him throned in Gylfi's land:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Summoning his race around him thus he spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"My sons, I scorn that age should cumber youth!<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span><span class="i0">Ye have your lesson&mdash;see ye keep it well!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I taught you how to conquer; how to live;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now learn to die!" His dagger high he raised;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nine times he plunged it through his bleeding breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then sheathed it in his heart. Ere from his lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The kingly smile had vanished, he was dead!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So sang the bard and ceased; his work was done:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abroad the tempest burst. 'Twas not his songs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone that raised it! Memories which they waked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Memories of childhood, fainter year by year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tripled his might. Meantime a Saxon priest<br /></span>

wood, expounds to them the Beatitudes of Our Lord. Wherever he goes
he seeks records of past times, and promises in return that he will

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The ending of the Book of Saxon Saints.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With one lay-brother only blessed Bede,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In after times 'The Venerable' named,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passed from his convent, Jarrow. Where the Tyne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blends with the sea, all beautiful it stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bathed in the sunrise. At the mouth of Wear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A second convent, Wearmouth, rose. That hour<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span><span class="i0">The self-same matin splendour gilt them both;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in some speech of mingling lights, not words,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both sisters praised their God.<br /></span>
<span class="i32">'Apart, yet joined'&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So mused the old man gazing on the twain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then onward paced, with head above his book,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Murmuring his office. Algar walked behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A youth of twenty years, with tonsured head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And face, though young, forlorn. An hour had passed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They reached a craggy height; and looking back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld once more beyond the forest roof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those two fair convents glittering&mdash;at their feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those two clear rivers winding! Bound by rule,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again the monk addressed him to his book;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lection and psalm recited, thus he spake:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">'Why placed our holy Founder thus so near<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His convents? Why, albeit a single rule,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last a single hand, had sway o'er both,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Placed them at distance? Hard it were to guess:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know but this, that severance here on earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is strangely linked with union of the heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Union with severance. Thou hast lost, young friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lately lost thy boyhood's dearest mate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thine earliest friend, a brother of thy heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">True Christian soul though dwelling in the world;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span><span class="i0">Fear not such severance can extinguish love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, or hereafter! He whom most I loved<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was severed from me by the tract of years:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A child of nine years old was I, when first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jarrow received me: pestilence ere long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swept from that house her monks, save one alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ceolfrid, then its abbot. Man and child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We two the lonely cloisters paced; we two<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Together chaunted in the desolate church:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could not guess his thoughts; to him my ways<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were doubtless as the ways of some sick bird<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watched by a child. Not less I loved him well:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Me too he somewhat loved. Beneath one roof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We dwelt&mdash;and yet how severed! Save in God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What know men, one of other? Here on earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps 'tis wiser to be kind to all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In large goodwill of helpful love, yet free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than link to one our heart&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor youth! that love which walks in narrow ways<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is tragic love, be sure.'<br /></span>
<span class="i26">With gentle face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The novice spake his gratitude. Once more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hand upon the shoulder of the youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(For now they mounted slow a bosky dell)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old man spake&mdash;yet not to him&mdash;in voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce louder than the murmuring pines close by;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span><span class="i0">For, by his being's law he seemed, like them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At times when pensive memories in him stirred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vocal not less than visible: 'How great<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was he, our Founder! In that ample brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What brooding weight of genius! In his eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How strangely was the pathos edged with light!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How oft, his churches roaming, flashed its beam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From pillar on to pillar, resting long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On carven imagery of flower or fruit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or deep-dyed window whence the heavenly choirs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave joy to men below! With what a zeal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He drew the cunningest craftsmen from all climes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To express his thoughts in form; while yet his hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like meanest hand among us, patient toiled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In garden and in bakehouse, threshed the corn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or drave the calves to milk-pail! Earthly rule<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had proved to him a weight intolerable;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In spiritual beauty, there and there alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our Bennett Biscop found his native haunt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lucent planet of his soul's repose:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet&mdash;O wondrous might of human love&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One was there, one, to whom his heart was knit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Siegfried, in all unlike him save in worth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His was plain purpose, rectitude unwarped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Industry, foresight. On his friend's behalf<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He ruled long years those beauteous convents twain,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span><span class="i0">Yet knew not they were beauteous! An abyss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Severed in spirit those in heart so near:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More late exterior severance came: three years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In cells remote they dwelt, by sickness chained:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But once they met&mdash;to die. I see them still:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The monks had laid them on a single bed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weeping, they turned them later each to each:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw the snowy tresses softly mix;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw the faded lips draw near and meet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus gently interwreathed I saw them die&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strange strength of human love!'<br /></span>
<span class="i34">Still walked they on:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As high the sun ascended, woodlands green<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shivered all golden; and the old man's heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brightened like them. His ever active mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inquisitive took note of all it saw;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as some youth enamoured lifts a tress<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her he loves, and wonders, so the monk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well loving Nature, loved her in detail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now pleased with nestling bird, anon with flower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now noting how the beech from dewy sheath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pushed forth its silken leaflets fringed with down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exulting next because from sprays of lime<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The little fledgeling leaves, like creatures winged,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brake from their ruddy shells. Jesting, he cried:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Algar! but hear those birds! Men say they sing<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span><span class="i0">To fire their young, night-bound, with gladsome news,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bid them seek the sun!' Sadly the youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With downward front, replied: 'My friend is dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For me to gladden were to break a troth.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the brow of Bede a shadow fell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silent he paced, then stopped: 'Forgive me, Algar!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old men grow hard. Yet boys and girls salute<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The May: like them the old must have their maying;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is perchance my last.'<br /></span>
<span class="i28">As thus he spake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They reached the summit of a grassy hill;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath there wound a stream, upon its marge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hamlet nestling lonely in the woods:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its inmates saw the Saint, and t'wards him sped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eager as birds that, when the grain is flung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fountained cloister-court of Eastern church,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From all sides flock, with sudden rush of wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Darkening the pavement. Youths and maids came first;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their elders followed: some his garments kissed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some his hands. The venerable man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stretched forth his arms, as though to clasp them all:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above them next he signed his Master's cross;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, while the tears ran down his aged face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brake forth in grateful joy; 'To God the praise!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, forty years ago, I roamed this vale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A haunt it was of rapine and of wars;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span><span class="i0">Now see I pleasant pastures, peaceful homes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And faces peacefuller yet. That God Who walked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With His disciples 'mid the sabbath fields<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While they the wheat-ears bruised, His sabbath keeps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within your hearts this day! His harvest ye!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more a-hungered are His holy priests;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They hunger for your souls; with reverent palms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Daily the chaff they separate from the grain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Daily His Church within her heart receives you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, with her heavenly substance makes you one;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye grow to be her eyes that see His truth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her ears that hear His voice; her hands that pluck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His tree of life; her feet that walk His ways.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Honouring God's priests ye err not, O my friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since thus ye honour God. In Him rejoice!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">So spake he, and his gladness kindled theirs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With it their courage. One her infant brought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sued for him a blessing. One, bereaved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cried out: 'Your promised peace has come at last;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more I wish him back to earth!' Again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old foes shook hands; while now, their fears forgot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Children that lately nestled at his feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clomb to his knees. Then called from out that crowd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A blind man; 'Read once more that Book of God!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, after you had left us, many a month<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span><span class="i0">I, who can neither see the sun nor moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw oft the God-Man walking farms and fields<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that fair Eastern land!' He spake, and lo!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All those around that heard him clamoured, 'Read!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Then Bede, the Sacred Scriptures opening, lit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the 'Sermon on the Mount,' and read:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'The Saviour lifted up His holy eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On His disciples, saying, Blessed they;'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Expounding next the sense. 'Why fixed the Lord<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His eyes on them that listened? Friends, His eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go down through all things, searching out the heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sees if heart be sound to hold His Word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bring forth fruit in season, or as rock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Naked to bird that plucks the random seed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Friends, with the heart alone we understand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who doth His will shall of the doctrine know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If His it be indeed. When Jesus speaks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fix first your eyes upon His eyes divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There reading what He sees within your heart:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If sin He sees, repent!'<br /></span>
<span class="i26">With hands upheld<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A woman raised her voice, and cried aloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Could we but look into the eyes of Christ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nought should we see but love!' And Bede replied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'From babe and suckling God shall perfect praise!<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span><span class="i0">Yea, from His eyes looks forth the Eternal Love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though oft, through sin of ours, in sadness veiled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when He rests them on disciples true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not on the stranger, love is love alone!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O great, true hearts that love so well your Lord!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That heard so trustingly His tidings good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So long, by trial proved, have kept His Faith,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To you He cometh&mdash;cometh with reward<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In heaven, and here on earth.'<br /></span>
<span class="i32">With brightening face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As one who flingeth largess far abroad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more he raised the sacred tome, and read,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Read loud the Eight Beatitudes of Christ;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then ceased, but later spake: 'In ampler phrase<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those Blessings ye shall hear once more rehearsed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And deeplier understand them. Blessed they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The poor in spirit; for to humble hearts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Belongs the kingdom of their God in heaven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blessed the meek&mdash;nor gold they boast, nor power;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet theirs alone the sweetness of this earth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blessed are they who mourn, for on their hearts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The consolation of their God shall fall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blessed are they who hunger and who thirst<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For righteousness; they shall be satisfied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blessed the merciful, for unto them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The God of mercy mercy shall accord;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span><span class="i0">Blessed are they, the pure in heart; their eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall see their God: Blessed the peacemakers;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This title man shall give them&mdash;Sons of God;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blessed are they who suffer for the cause<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Righteous and just: a throne is theirs on high:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blessed are ye when sinners cast you forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brand your name with falsehood for my sake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rejoice, for great is your reward in heaven.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Once more the venerable man made pause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Giving his Master's Blessings time to sink<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through hearts of those who heard. Anon with speech<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though fervent, grave, he shewed the glory and grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of those majestic Virtues crowned by Christ,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While virtues praised by worldlings passed unnamed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How wondrously consentient each with each,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like flowers well sorted, or like notes well joined:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then changed the man to deeper theme; he shewed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How these high virtues, ere to man consigned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were warmed and moulded in the God-Man's heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thence born, and in its sacred blood baptized.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'What are these virtues but the life of Christ?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The poor in spirit; must not they be lowly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose God is One that stooped to wear our flesh?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The meek; was He not meek Whom sinners mocked?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mourners; sent not He the Comforter?<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span><span class="i0">Zeal for the good; was He not militant?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The merciful; He came to bring us mercy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pure in heart; was He not virgin-born?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peacemakers; is not He the Prince of Peace?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sufferers for God; He suffered first for man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Virtues blest by Christ, high doctrines ye!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dread mysteries; royal records; standards red<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrapped by the warrior King, His warfare past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around His soldiers' bosoms! Recognise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O man, that majesty in lowness hid!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Put on Christ's garments. Fools shall call them rags&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heed not their scoff! A prince's child is man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Born in the purple; but his royal robes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None other are than those the Saviour dyed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Treading His Passion's wine-press all alone:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of such alone be proud!'<br /></span>
<span class="i27">The old man paused;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then stretched his arms abroad, and said: 'This day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like eight great angels making way from Heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each following each, those Eight Beatitudes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Missioned to earth by Him who made the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have sought you out! What welcome shall be theirs?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In silence long he stood; in silence watched,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With faded cheek now flushed and widening eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The advance of those high tidings. As a man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, when the sluice is cut, with beaming gaze<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span><span class="i0">Pursues the on-rolling flood from fall to fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Green branch adown it swept, and showery spray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silvering the berried copse, so followed Bede<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The progress of those high Beatitudes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brightening, with visible beams of faith and love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That host in ampler circles, speechless some<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some in passionate converse. Saddest brows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Most quickly caught, that hour, the glory-touch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reflected it the best.<br /></span>
<span class="i24">In such discourse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peaceful and glad the hours went by, though Bede<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had sought that valley less to preach the Word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than see once more his children. Evening nigh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He shared their feast; and heard with joy like theirs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their village harp; and smote that harp himself.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In turn become their scholar, hour by hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forth dragged he records of their chiefs and kings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Untangling ravelled evidence, and still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tracking traditions upward to their source,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like him, that Halicarnassean sage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of antique history sire. 'I trust, my friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To leave your sons, for lore by you bestowed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair recompense, large measure well pressed down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Recording still God's kingdom in this land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">History which all may read, and gentle hearts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loving, may grow in grace. Long centuries passed,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span><span class="i0">If wealth should make this nation's heart too fat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And things of earth obscure the things of heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haply such chronicle may prompt high hearts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wearied with shining nothings, back to cast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remorseful gaze through mists of time, and note<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That rock whence they were hewn. From youth to age<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inmate of yonder convent on the Tyne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I question every pilgrim, priest, or prince,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or peasant grey, and glean from each his sheaf:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Likewise the Bishops here and Abbots there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still send me deed of gift, or chronicle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or missive from the Apostolic See:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Praise be to God Who fitteth for his place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not only high but mean! With wisdom's strength<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He filled our mitred Wilfred, born to rule;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To saintly Cuthbert gave the spirit of prayer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On me, as one late born, He lays a charge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slender, yet helpful still.'<br /></span>
<span class="i28">Then spake a man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burly and big, that last at banquet sat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Father, is history true?' and Bede replied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'The man who seeks for Truth like hidden gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shrinks from falsehood as a leper's touch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall write true history; not the truth unmixed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fancies, base or high; not truth entire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet truth beneficent to man below.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span><span class="i0">One Book there is that errs not: ye this day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have learned therefrom your Lord's Beatitudes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Book contains its histories&mdash;like them none,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since written none from standing point so high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With insight so inspired, such measure just<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of good and ill; high fruit of aid divine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The slothful spurn that Book; the erroneous warp:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But they who read its page, or hear it read,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their guide, God's Spirit, and the Church of God,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall hear the voice of Truth for ever nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall see the Truth, now sunlike, and anon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like dagger-point of light from dewy grass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flashed up, a word that yet confutes a life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pierces, perchance a nation's heart: shall see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far more&mdash;the Truth Himself in human form,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Walking not farms and fields of Eastern lands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone, but these our English fields and farms;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall see Him on the dusky mount at prayer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall see Him in the street and by the bier;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall see Him at the feast, and at the grave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now from the boat discoursing, and anon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Staying the storm, or walking on its waves;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus shall our land become a holy land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And holy those who tread her!' Lifting then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heavenward that tome, he said, 'The Book of God!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As stands God's Church, 'mid kingdoms of this world<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span><span class="i0">Holy alone, so stands, 'mid books, this Book!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the "Upper Chamber" once that Church<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lived in small space; to-day she fills the world:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This Book which seems so narrow is a world:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is an Eden of mankind restored;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is a heavenly city lit with God:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From it the Spirit and the Bride say "Come:"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blessed who reads this Book!'<br /></span>
<span class="i31">Above the woods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime the stars shone forth; and came that hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When to the wanderer and the toiling man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Repose is sweet. Upon a leaf-strewn bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The venerable man slept well that night:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next morning young and old pursued his steps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As southward he departed. From a hill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er-looking far that sea-like forest tract<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a church far-kenned through smokeless air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He blessed that kneeling concourse, adding thus,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Pray still, O friends, for me, since spiritual foes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Threat most the priesthood:&mdash;pray that holy death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Due warning given, may close a life too blest!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pray well, since I for you have laboured well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, and will labour till my latest sigh;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not only seeking you in wilds and woods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Year after year, but in my cell at night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Changing to accents of your native tongue<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span><span class="i0">God's Book Divine. Farewell, my friends, farewell!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He left them; in his heart this thought, 'How like<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The great death-parting every parting seems!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But deathless hopes were with him; and the May;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His grief went by.<br /></span>
<span class="i19">So passed a day of Bede's;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many a studious year were stored with such;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enough but one for sample. Two glad weeks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He and his comrade onward roved. At eve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Convent or hamlet, known long since and loved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gladly received them. Bede with heart as glad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Renewed with them the memory of old times,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Recounted benefits by him received,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then strong in youth, from just men passed away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And preached his Master still with power so sweet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The listeners ne'er forgat him. Evermore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Parting, he planted in the ground a cross,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bade the neighbours till their church was built<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round it to pray. Meanwhile his youthful mate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Changed by degrees. The ever varying scene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The biting breath and balmy breast of spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And most of all that old man's valiant heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Triumphed above his sadness, fancies gay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pushing beyond it like those sunnier shoots<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That gild the dark vest of the vernal pine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He took account of all things as they passed;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span><span class="i0">He laughed; he told his tale. With quiet joy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His friend remarked that change. The second week<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They passed to Durham; next to Walsingham;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Gilling then; to stately Richmond soon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High throned above her Ouse; to Ripon last:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Bede made pause, and spake; 'Not far is York;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Egbert who fills Paulinus' saintly seat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would see me gladly: such was mine intent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But something in my bosom whispers, "Nay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Return to that fair river crossed by night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Tees, the fairest in this Northern land:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside its restless wave thine eye shall rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On vision lovelier far and more benign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than all it yet hath seen."' Northward once more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They faced, and, three days travelling, reached at eve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again those ivied cliffs that guard the Tees:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There as they stood a homeward dove, with flight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Softer for contrast with that turbulent stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sailed through the crimson eve. 'No sight like that!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus murmured Bede; 'ever to me it seems<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Christian soul returning to its rest.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shade came o'er his countenance as he mused;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Algar remarked that shade, though what it meant<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knew not yet. The old man from that hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed mirthful less, less buoyant, beaming less,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet not less glad.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
<span class="i20">At dead of night, while hung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sacred stars upon their course half way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He left his couch, and thus to Egbert wrote,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meek man&mdash;too meek&mdash;the brother of the king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With brow low bent, and onward sweeping hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great words, world-famed: 'Remember thine account!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Lord's Apostles are the salt of earth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let salt not lose its savour! Flail and fan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are given thee. Purge thou well thy threshing floor!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Repel the tyrant; hurl the hireling forth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That so from thy true priests true hearts may learn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">True faith, true love, and nothing but the truth!'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Before the lark he rose the morrow morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stood by Algar's bed, and spake: 'Arise!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Playtime is past; the great, good work returns;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Jarrow speed we!' Homeward, day by day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thenceforth they sped with foot that lagged no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That youth, at first so mournful, joyous now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That old man oft in thought. Next day, while eve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Descended dim, and clung to Hexham's groves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He passed its abbey, silent. Wonder-struck<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Algar demanded, 'Father, pass you thus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That church where holy John<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> ordained you priest?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pass you its Bishop, Acca, long your friend?<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span><span class="i0">Yearly he woos your visit; tells you tales<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Hexham's saintly Wilfred; shows you still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chalice or cross new-won from distant shores:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor these alone:&mdash;glancing from such last year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A page he read you of some Pagan bard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With smiles; yet ended with a sigh, and said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Where is he now?"' The man of God replied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Desire was mine to see mine ancient friend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that cause came I hither:&mdash;time runs short':&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, Algar sighing, thus he added mild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Let go that theme; thy mourning time is past:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy gladsome time is now.' As on they walked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Later he spake: 'It may be I was wrong;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old friends should part in hope.'<br /></span>
<span class="i35">On Jarrow's towers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright as that sunrise while that pair went forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sunset glittered when, their wanderings past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bede and his comrade by the bank of Tyne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more approached the gates. Six hundred monks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flocked forth to meet them. 'They had grieved, I know,'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus spake, low-voiced, the venerable man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'If I had died remote. To spare that grief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the time intended I returned.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sadly that comrade looked upon his face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet saw there nought of sadness. Silent each<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Advanced they till they met that cowl√®d host:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span><span class="i0">But three weeks later on his bed the boy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remembered well those words.<br /></span>
<span class="i32">Within a cell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Algar's near that later night a youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrote thus to one far off, his earliest friend:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'O blessed man! was e'er a death so sweet!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sang that verse, "A dreadful thing it is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fall into the hands of God, All-Just;"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet awe in him seemed swallowed up by love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ofttimes with the Prophets and the Psalms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He mixed glad minstrelsies of English speech,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Songs to his childhood dear!<br /></span>
<span class="i30">'O blessed man!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Ascension Feast of Christ our Lord drew nigh;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He watched that splendour's advent; sang its hymn:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"All-glorious King, Who, triumphing this day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the heaven of heavens didst make ascent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forsake us not, poor orphans! Send Thy Spirit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Spirit of Truth, the Father's promised Gift,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To comfort us, His children: Hallelujah."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when he reached that word, "Forsake us not,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He wept&mdash;not tears of grief. With him we wept;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alternate wept; alternate read our rite;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, while we wept we read. So passed that day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sufferer thanking God with labouring breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"God scourges still the son whom He receives."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span><span class="i2">'Undaunted, unamazed, daily he wrought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His daily task; instruction daily gave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To us his scholars round him ranged, and said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I will not have my pupils learn a lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor, fruitless, toil therein when I am gone."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full well he kept an earlier promise, made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ofttimes to humble folk, in English tongue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rendering the Gospels of the Lord. On these,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The last of these, the Gospel of Saint John,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He laboured till the close. The days went by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still he toiled, and panted, and gave thanks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To God with hands uplifted; yea, in sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He made thanksgiving still. When Tuesday came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Suffering increased; he said, "My time is short;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How short it is I know not." Yet we deemed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knew the time of his departure well.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">'On Wednesday morn once more he bade us write:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We wrote till the third hour, and left him then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pace, in reverence of that Feast all-blest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our cloister court with hymns. Meantime a youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Algar by name, there was who left him never;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The same that hour beside him sat and wrote:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More late he questioned: "Father well-beloved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One chapter yet remaineth; have you strength<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To dictate more?" He answered: "I have strength;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span><span class="i0">Make ready, son, thy pen, and swiftly write."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When noon had come he turned him round and said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I have some little gifts for those I love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Call in the Brethren;" adding with a smile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The rich man makes bequests, and why not I?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then gifts he gave, incense or altar-cloth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To each, commanding, "Pray ye for my soul;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be strong in prayer and offering of the Mass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ye shall see my face no more on earth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blessed hath been my life; and time it is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That unto God God's creature should return;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, I desire to die, and be with Christ."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus speaking, he rejoiced till evening's shades<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Darkened around us. That disciple young<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more addressed him, "Still one verse remains;"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The master answered, "Write, and write with speed;"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dictated. The young man wrote; then said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"'Tis finished now." The man of God replied:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Well say'st thou, son, ''tis finished.' In thy hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Receive my head, and move it gently round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For comfort great it is, and joy in death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, on this pavement of my little cell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Facing that happy spot whereon so oft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In prayer I knelt, to sit once more in prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thanking my Father." "Glory," then he sang,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"To God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost;"<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span><span class="i0">And with that latest Name upon his lips<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passed to the Heavenly Kingdom.'<br /></span>
<span class="i34">Thus with joy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Died holy Bede upon Ascension Day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Jarrow Convent. May he pray for us,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all who read his annals of God's Church<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In England housed, his great bequest to man!<br /></span>

<h2><a name="NOTES" id="NOTES"></a>NOTES.</h2>


<p><a href="#Page_xxxvi">Page xxxvi</a>. <i>The Irish Mission in England during the seventh century was
one of the great things of history.</i></p>

<p>The following expressions of Dr. von D√∂llinger respecting the Irish
Church are more ardent than any I have ventured to use:&mdash;</p>

<p>'During the sixth and seventh centuries the Church of Ireland stood in
the full beauty of its bloom. The spirit of the Gospel operated amongst
the people with a vigorous and vivifying power: troops of holy men, from
the highest to the lowest ranks of society, obeyed the counsel of
Christ, and forsook all things that they might follow Him. There was not
a country in the world, during this period, which could boast of pious
foundations or of religious communities equal to those that adorned this
far distant island. Among the Irish the doctrines of the Christian
religion were preserved pure and entire; the names of heresy or of
schism were not known to them; and in the Bishop of Rome they
acknowledged and venerated the Supreme Head of the Church on earth, and
continued with him, and through him with the whole Church, in a never
interrupted communion. The schools in the Irish cloisters were at this
time the most celebrated in all the West.... The strangers who visited
the island, not only from the neighbouring shores of Britain, but also
from the most remote nations of the Continent, received from the Irish
people the most hospitable reception, a gratuitous entertainment, free
instruction, and even the books that were necessary for the studies....
On the other hand, many holy and learned Irish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>men left their own
country to proclaim the Faith, to establish or to reform monasteries in
distant lands, and thus to become the benefactors of almost every
country in Europe.... The foundation of many of the English Sees is due
to Irishmen.... These holy men served God, and not the world; they
possessed neither gold nor silver, and all that they received from the
rich passed through their hands into the hands of the poor. Kings and
nobles visited them from time to time only to pray in their churches, or
to listen to their sermons; and as long as they remained in the
cloisters they were content with the humble food of the brethren.
Wherever one of these ecclesiastics or monks came, he was received by
all with joy; and whenever he was seen journeying across the country,
the people streamed around him to implore his benediction, and to
hearken to his words. The priests entered the villages only to preach or
to administer the Sacraments; and so free were they from avarice, that
it was only when compelled by the rich and noble that they would accept
lands for the erection of monasteries.'</p>


<p><a href="#Page_xliii">Page xliii</a>. <i>For both countries that early time was a period of
wonderful spiritual greatness.</i></p>

<p>I cannot deny myself the pleasure of quoting the following passage
illustrating the religious greatness both of the Irish and the English
at the period referred to:&mdash;</p>

<p>'The seventh and eighth centuries are the glory of the Anglo-Saxon
Church, as the sixth and seventh are of the Irish. As the Irish
missionaries travelled down through England, France, and Switzerland, to
Lower Italy, and attempted Germany at the peril of their lives,
converting the barbarian, restoring the lapsed, encouraging the
desolate, collecting the scattered, and founding churches, schools, and
monasteries as they went along; so amid the deep pagan woods of Germany,
and round about, the English Benedictine plied his axe, and drove his
plough, planted his rude dwelling, and raised his rustic altar upon the
ruins of idolatry; and then, settling down as a colonist upon the soil,
began to sing his chants and to copy his old volumes, and thus to lay
the slow but <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>sure foundations of the new civilisation. Distinct, nay
antagonistic, in character and talents, the one nation and the other,
Irish and English&mdash;the one more resembling the Greek, the other the
Roman&mdash;open from the first perhaps to jealousies as well as rivalries,
they consecrated their respective gifts to the Almighty Giver, and,
labouring together for the same great end, they obliterated whatever
there was of human infirmity in their mutual intercourse by the merit of
their common achievements. Each by turn could claim pre-eminence in the
contest of sanctity and learning. In the schools of science England has
no name to rival Erigena in originality, or St. Virgil in freedom of
thought; nor (among its canonised women) any saintly virgin to compare
with St. Bridget; nor, although it has 150 saints in its calendar, can
it pretend to equal that Irish multitude which the Book of Life alone is
large enough to contain. Nor can Ireland, on the other hand, boast of a
doctor such as St. Bede, or of an apostle equal to St. Boniface, or of a
martyr like St. Thomas; or of so long a catalogue of royal devotees as
that of the thirty male or female Saxons who, in the course of two
centuries, resigned their crowns; or as the roll of twenty-three kings,
and sixty queens and princes, who, between the seventh and the eleventh
centuries, gained a place among the saints.'&mdash;Cardinal Newman, <i>Historic
Sketches</i>, 'The Isles of the North,' pp. 128-9.</p>

<p>'Whilst Sigebert still governed the kingdom there came out of Ireland a
holy man named Fursey, renowned both for his words and actions, and
remarkable for singular virtues, being desirous to live a stranger for
Our Lord, wherever an opportunity should offer.... He built himself the
monastery (Burghcastle in Suffolk) wherein he might with more freedom
indulge his heavenly studies. There falling sick, as the book about his
life informs us, he fell into a trance, and, quitting his body from the
evening till the cockcrow, he was found worthy to behold the choirs of
angels, and hear the praises which are sung in heaven.... He not only
saw the greater joys of the Blessed, but also extraordinary combats of
Evil Spirits.'&mdash;Bede, <i>Hist.</i> book iii. cap. xix. 'C'√©tait un moine

<i>Collectanea</i>, ap. Dugdale, t. I. p. 173; cf. Bolland, t. viii. October,
p. 535 √† 568. I learn from a Catholic prayer book published in 1720 that
the Saint's Feast used to be kept on the 19th of October. Her remains,
as is commonly believed, still exist in the Cathedral of Oxford.</p>


<p><a href="#Page_240">Page 240</a>. <i>Your teacher he: he taught you first your Runes.</i></p>

<p>'The Icelandic chronicles point out Odin as the most persuasive of men.
They tell us that nothing could resist the force of his words; that he
sometimes enlivened his harangues with verses, which he composed
extempore; and that he was not only a great poet, but that it was he who
first taught the art of poesy to the Scandinavians. He was also the
inventor of the Runic characters.'&mdash;<i>Northern Antiquities</i>, p. 83.
Mallet asserts that it was to Christianity that the Scandinavians owed
the practical use of those Runes which they had possessed for
centuries:&mdash;'nor did they during so many years ever think of committing
to writing those verses with which their memories were loaded; and it is
probable that they only wrote down a small quantity of them at last....
Among the innumerable advantages which accrued to the Northern nations
from the introduction of the Christian religion, that of teaching them
to apply the knowledge of letters to useful purposes is not the least
valuable. Nor could a motive less sacred have eradicated that habitual
and barbarous prejudice which caused them to neglect so admirable a
secret.'&mdash;P. 234. Mallet's statement respecting the Greek emigration of
the Northern 'Barbarians' from the East is thus confirmed by Burke.
'There is an unquestioned tradition among the Northern nations of Europe
importing that all that part of the world had suffered a great and
general revolution by a migration from Asiatic Tartary of a people whom
they call Asers. These everywhere expelled or subdued the ancient
inhabitants of the Celtick or Cimbrick original. The leader of this
Asiatic army was called Odin, or Wodin; first their general, afterwards
their tutelar deity.... The Saxon nation believed themselves the
descend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>ants of those conquerors.' Burke, <i>Abridgment of English
History</i>, book ii. cap. i.</p>


<p><a href="#Page_252">Page 252</a>. <i>Like hunters chasing hart, to sea-beat cliffs.</i></p>

<p>This is recorded by Lingard and Burke.</p>


<p><a href="#Page_259">Page 259</a>. <i>Bede's Last May.</i></p>

<p>This narrative of the death of Bede is closely taken from a letter
written by Cuthbert, a pupil of his, then residing in Jarrow, to a
fellow-pupil at a distance. An English version of that letter is
prefixed to Dr. Giles's translation of <i>Bede's Ecclesiastical History</i>.
(Henry G. Bohn.) The death of Bede took place on Wednesday, May 26, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>
735, being Ascension Day.</p>


<p><a href="#Page_265">Page 265</a>. <i>They hunger for your souls; with reverent palms.</i></p>

<p>'But in a mystical sense the disciples pass through the cornfields when
the holy Doctors look with the care of a pious solicitude upon those
whom they have initiated in the Faith, and who, it is implied, are
hungering for the best of all things&mdash;the salvation of men. But to pluck
the ears of corn means to snatch men away from the eager desire of
earthly things. And to rub with the hands is, by examples of virtue, to
put from the purity of their minds the concupiscence of the flesh, as
men do husks. To eat the grains is when a man, cleansed from the filth
of vice by the mouths of preachers, is incorporated amongst the members
of the Church.'&mdash;Bede, quoted in the <i>Catena Aurea</i>. <i>Commentary on St.
Mark</i>, cap. ii. v. 23.</p>
